Moderna says early data suggest its COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effective


The first results from the Cambridge company’s late-stage clinical trial show its product has about the same efficacy as a rival one Pfizer’s testing


By Jonathan Saltzman Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 9:35 a.m.

Moderna said Monday that initial data from a late-stage clinical trial indicate that its COVID-19 vaccine was nearly 95 percent effective at preventing infections, a remarkable showing for any vaccine, let alone one based on novel technology.

Although the analysis is preliminary, the Cambridge biotech said it hopes to seek emergency use of the experimental vaccine for some people “in the coming weeks” and expects to have about 20 million doses to ship in the United States by year’s end. That would be enough for 10 million people, given that vaccination requires two doses.

The first interim review of data in the study of more than 30,000 volunteers at 100 trial sites in the country indicated that the vaccine showed about the same effectiveness as a rival one being tested by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. That company reported a week ago that two doses of its vaccine appeared to be more than 90 percent effective.



“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Moderna’s chief executive, Stephane Bancel.

Moderna’s stock rose 9.6 percent to $97.95 Monday.

The analysis, done by an independent monitoring board, does not mean an effective vaccine is imminent, but the early results are impressive. The board analyzed the first 95 cases of COVID-19 among volunteers who received two shots four weeks apart and then went about their daily lives. Half of all participants in the trial got the vaccine. The other half got placebo shots.

On Sunday afternoon, the board informed Moderna that only five of the 95 people who caught COVID-19 had gotten the vaccine, said Ray Jordan, a spokesman for the company. The other 90 cases occurred in recipients of the placebo. The results indicate the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent, the company said.

“Honestly, I would not have expected that," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with STAT News, responding to the early vaccine data from Moderna and Pfizer. "I thought that was too much to hope for.”

Fauci, the top US infectious-disease doctor, said earlier this year that he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that was 60 percent effective.

The interim analysis reported no significant safety concerns and indicated that the Moderna vaccine was generally well tolerated. Most side effects were mild or moderate and generally short-lived and included symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and achiness.

Moderna officials were particularly delighted by how well the vaccine appeared to prevent severe cases of COVID-19. Eleven of the 95 people infected with the virus in the data snapshot were diagnosed with severe cases. All 11 cases occurred in the placebo group — none in the group that got the vaccine.

The vaccine trial was closely monitored to ensure that participants reflect the country’s diverse population. Moderna has said that minorities make up more than a third of the 30,000-person trial.

“It wasn’t as if the only people who were protected were the young people. There were people in the elderly, there were people in the minorities,” Fauci said in the interview with STAT News. Efficacy was “really consistent across all groups.”

Based on the data, Moderna said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve the vaccine for at least some people on an emergency basis in the coming weeks. It said the FDA would wait for a final analysis of a total of 151 cases of COVID-19 among volunteers in the trial before deciding.

Alan Carr, an analyst, on Monday wrote to investors that the early data represent "an impressive outcome in our opinion, and we believe issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization may be feasible in December.”

The first doses of any vaccine authorized for emergency use are expected to go to people at high risk for catching COVID-19 or for suffering serious complications, including medical workers and the elderly.

Pfizer has said it expects to produce up to 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of the year, 2½ times the amount Moderna hopes to have in the same time frame. Pfizer’s vaccine also requires two shots, so 50 million doses would be enough for 25 million people.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines rely on synthetic messenger RNA, an ingenious variation on the natural substance that directs protein production in cells throughout the body. The vaccines contain custom-made messenger molecules that instruct cells to create a part of the coronavirus and then stimulate the immune system to make antibodies. If it works, that would protect people if they ever got infected with the actual virus.

There are a dozen coronavirus vaccine candidates in late-stage trials globally, and they employ a variety of approaches. The US government’s Operation Warp Speed has bankrolled a handful of vaccine candidates with billions of dollars.

The government has pledged up to $2.48 billion to Moderna to develop its vaccine and provide at least 100 million doses. Pfizer opted not to take any federal money upfront but will, along with its German partner, BioNTech, receive $1.95 billion from the government to produce at least 100 million doses if the vaccine gets approved.

Dr. Paul Offit, an authority on vaccines at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the preliminary results from the Moderna study are “very encouraging” and validate the data that Pfizer released Nov. 9. He was particularly impressed that none of the volunteers who suffered severe cases of COVID-19 had received the vaccine.

Nonetheless, he noted that no messenger RNA vaccine or drug has won approval before and said it was premature to celebrate.

“You’d like to see all the data rather than the data that companies put out by press releases,” he said.

Moderna also reported Monday that its vaccine candidate remains stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 days, up from the company’s previous estimate of seven days. And it remains stable for up to six months in a freezer set at minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit, the company said.

One of the concerns about the messenger RNA vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is that it must be kept at minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. Those cold-storage requirements have raised serious questions about whether hospitals could safely store the vaccine and how easily it could be shipped around the world.

The ability to store the Moderna vaccine in commonly used pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators “would enable simpler distribution and [provide] more flexibility to facilitate wider-scale vaccination in the United States and other parts of the world,” said Juan Andres, chief of technical operations at Moderna.

The preliminary data appeared to buoy hopes as the pandemic surges in various parts of the world, including the United States, where the virus has caused at least 246,000 deaths.

Like the leaders of other companies testing experimental vaccines, Moderna’s Bancel has said it will take more than one approved COVID-19 vaccine to tame the pandemic; no single company can produce enough doses to protect the world’s 7.8 billion people.

If Moderna’s vaccine ultimately wins FDA approval, it would represent a singular achievement for a company that has generated high hopes but had its doubters. Founded a decade ago, Moderna raised more than $2 billion in venture capital and partnership funds before going public in 2018, based on the promise of its mRNA technology.

The company raised more than $600 million in the initial public offering, which shattered the record for the largest biotech IPO in history. Nonetheless, Moderna has no approved products — not unheard of among high-flying biotechs — and has struggled to create a fleet of mRNA medicines that could be safely dosed repeatedly.

“It’s increasingly evident that the coronavirus vaccine will be its first product, and it will probably be a significant revenue generator in the near-term,” Carr, the analyst, said. “But in the long term I think it’s a good indicator for the rest of their infectious disease pipeline.”

Moderna is working on mRNA vaccines for a host of other diseases, including the flu and serious respiratory illnesses, he said, and will need some to succeed to sustain its impressive market value of more than $38 billion.

Here’s what you need to know about the Moderna vaccine announcement





By Kay Lazar and Jonathan Saltzman Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 1:49 p.m.

The coronavirus vaccine developed by Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. made headlines Monday. Here is a quick rundown on what you need to know:

What’s today’s news?

Moderna said Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine had proven highly effective at preventing coronavirus infections, in the first glimpse of data from its late-stage clinical trial. The news offered another glimmer of light at the end of the coronavirus pandemic tunnel, though experts are still warning there are some deadly and depressing months ahead as cases rise nationwide.



What about the Pfizer vaccine?

This is the second piece of good news regarding vaccines in recent days. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer reported a week ago that its vaccine candidate was also highly effective. More vaccines may also be on the way: There are a dozen coronavirus vaccine candidates in late-stage trials globally.

How excited should we get?

Cautious optimism is in order. Both Moderna and Pfizer still need to complete their large-scale trials involving thousands of participants. The data released so far are interim results that do not answer key questions, including how long protection against infection might last. Consider that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in self-quarantine after being in contact with someone with COVID-19. Back in April, Johnson was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus. “It’s not common, but we have seen sporadic examples of people who have been infected a second time, and we don’t know if that will be the exception or the rule,” said Michael Kinch, director of the Centers for Research Innovation in Biotechnology & Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

The two-dose vaccines also will be logistically challenging to distribute to millions of people. And the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at super-cold temperatures.

When will people get the shots?

Both Moderna and Pfizer say they expect to complete more testing and submit their results to federal regulators in the coming weeks for emergency use approval, and both have said they expect to start shipping out millions of doses before the end of the year. But so far, most experts believe there will only be enough to target health care workers, people in elder care facilities, and those with underlying health conditions first.

Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said Monday on NBC’s “Today” show, “We project that by the end of December, that there will be doses of vaccines available for individuals in the higher-risk category, from both companies, we hope, and this is something that we’re looking forward to.” He said “we want to really get the ball rolling as we get into January, February, and March.”

Fauci said last week he expected vaccines to be more widely available in April.

The Moderna vaccine doesn’t need to be kept at super-cold temperatures. Is that a game-changer?

Moderna now says its vaccine candidate remains stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 days, up from the company’s previous estimate of seven days. And it remains stable for up to six months in a freezer set at minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit. Pfizer’s candidate needs to remain in super-cold storage — roughly minus-103 Fahrenheit — until ready for use, raising concerns about sufficient capacity of super-cold refrigeration units to safely deliver and store millions of doses around the world.

So the Moderna news will make a measurable difference, said Dr. Karen Tashima, director of clinical trials in the Immunology Center at the Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island. “We don’t want to waste vaccine if it’s been sitting in the refrigerator for 8 days. We don’t want to have to throw it out,” she said. “Now we have 30 days. People will feel a lot better about that.”

Will we get to choose which vaccine we receive?

It may depend on refrigeration. If Moderna’s vaccine gets the OK soon, it is expected to be more widely available to areas without super-cold storage capacity, compared with Pfizer’s vaccine. “The big cities that have access to deep freezers clustered around academic research centers, there you would probably use the Pfizer vaccine, whereas in the rural areas, or away from the medical centers, you would presumably want to utilize your warmer-temperature vaccine," Kinch said.

Are young people to blame for recent COVID-19 surges? Experts say the numbers are not conclusive


An increasing share of the state’s COVID cases are in people under 30, but other age groups have been infected at similar rates.


By Dasia Moore Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:54 p.m.



“There’s this kind of ever-looming fear on our campus of if someone gets caught [breaking a pandemic rule], they don’t know what’s going to happen," said Soraya Pierre-Louis, 22, a fifth-year biology student at Northeastern University.Erin Clark / Globe Staff





As COVID-19 once again grips the Northeast and the country, the message to twenty-somethings in particular has been consistent and clear: Get serious. Stop partying. You are endangering your communities.

Across the country and the world, young adults are making up an ever-increasing share of known COVID-19 cases, and public officials are not letting the trend go unnoticed.

In a recent overhaul of its daily dashboard, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health began highlighting the age breakdown of new cases, increasingly skewed toward young adults. Governor Charlie Baker — along with leaders across the region — has repeatedly admonished young people for flouting pandemic rules, pointing to house parties and other risky gatherings as drivers of the current surge.



But epidemiologists worry that officials' reprimands might be misdirected — and counterproductive.

“It may very well be true that small social gatherings or large social gatherings among young people are driving the pandemic, but I haven’t yet seen data to support that,” said Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.

Though infection rates have risen rapidly among young adults, Marcus and other experts warn that data explaining that trend are limited. Young people themselves say some of their peers may remedy isolation in irresponsible ways, but the social and economic realities of early adulthood also increase their risk: service industry work, reliance on public transit, crowded housing that helps lower costs but increases their exposure.

Regardless of why certain age groups are contracting COVID-19 — at work or parties, due to their recklessness or responsibilities — scientists said public officials should use compassion, not shame, to inform policy and curb infections.

“We know from other areas of public health, with HIV and substance use, that blaming people for their risky health behavior is not just ineffective, it can also be counterproductive,” Marcus said. “It perpetuates stigma, which drives people away from public health rather than engaging them, which is what we really want to do.”





The 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts has been over 1,000 since Oct. 24, marking the longest stretch since May with such high levels.

While all age groups have seen numbers rise throughout most of the late summer and fall, people in their 20s saw the highest rates of new probable and confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, data from the Public Health Department’s weekly reports show. In the past two weeks, 4,600 people aged 20-29 have tested positive for the disease.

Other working-age adults also have infection rates that exceed the state average. In recent weeks, rates among thirty-somethings have nearly kept pace with those among twenty-somethings, with people in their 40s not far behind. The distribution of cases has shifted dramatically since spring, with most reported cases showing up in people under 50 today, versus elders earlier in the pandemic.

“Our young people need to be serious about dealing with COVID,” Baker said in an October press conference. “COVID is a very contagious virus, and it will rear its ugly head wherever it gets the chance.”





Experts said there is good reason to be concerned about rising cases in young adults, as COVID-19 can be fatal for people of any age and the long-term effects of milder infections remain unknown.

Young people can also seed infection in their communities, said Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “We’re seeing the same pattern here [in the United States] that we’ve seen in Europe and other places, which is you see cases expand in the younger age groups, but then it’s followed by cases in older age groups and vulnerable populations,” she said.





The question of why young adults are getting infected is more complicated, experts said.

“I think there’s a tendency to envision that there are all these young people out at bars and parties, and that somehow it is irresponsible behavior [driving cases],” said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “I do not think the data per se can be interpreted to mean that.”

The same “overlapping social-political factors” that contribute to COVID-19 risk among the general population also apply to young people, she said.

For Maggie Timboe, 22, and Curt Mai, 21, what they see as the riskiest part of their routines is also the most necessary: Going to work.

Timboe, a food service worker, restricts her social circle to her boyfriend, with whom she lives in Allston, and four or five friends she only meets outdoors. She said she feels safe in her workplace but worries about contracting COVID-19 during her hourlong commute on the T.

“Mostly the experience [of the pandemic] has been the anxiety about traveling to work,” she said. “And really, in the last two weeks, the anxiety has gotten worse.”

“I’m a restaurant manager. Probably I interact with 1,000 customers a week,” said Mai, who lives with two roommates in Lowell. “I have no choice. That’s what I have to do to pay my bills, you know?”

Mai said he believed that in addition to service industry work, people his age are also put at risk by a “you only live once” mindset that leads some to throw caution — and their communities' health — to the wind, even though he said he and his friends take COVID-19 seriously.

Several young people voiced similar concerns about their peers more broadly, while insisting that they and the people they know are being careful. All balked at the idea that partying is driving infections. Several of the activities they think other young people are irresponsible for doing — dining in groups, going to the gym, traveling between states, taking public transit for leisure outings — are, in fact, allowed and deemed safe by officials.

“That people take their lead from the government is natural,” said one 32-year-old in Cambridge who has struggled to find common ground on pandemic safety with his roommate, who spends time in settings he thinks are unsafe, including gyms. He asked to stay anonymous out of concern that his roommate, the one person he sees regularly, would be upset.

Reopening “puts more undue burden on the individual” to determine what is safe, he said.

Soraya Pierre-Louis, a 22-year-old Northeastern University student, said that burden has been a defining feature of her senior year in college. Pierre-Louis plans to pursue a career in public health, in part because of the pandemic. But even for rule-followers like herself, she said, “There’s this kind of ever-looming fear on our campus of if someone gets caught [breaking a pandemic rule], they don’t know what’s going to happen."

Pervasive fear will not keep young people, or anyone, from taking risks, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist. But she said empathy might.

“We’re telling people to stay home as much as possible, but we have to recognize that that’s easier for some people than others,” Nuzzo said. “For someone in their early 20s who potentially doesn’t have a built-in social unit at home, their one source of social support is their friends.

“I say that not to absolve people but just to be realistic about what it’s going to take to control this virus,” she said.

“If we take a minute before yelling at people to actually ask why are people gathering right now, the answer is probably going to be that they need social connection,” said Marcus, the Harvard epidemiologist who studies stigma. “Once we can see what that unmet need is, we can help people find safer ways to do that.”

Alexandria Whitted, 22, has resorted to making new friends at the grocery store, one of the few places she ventures since moving to Brookline from North Carolina in August. Whitted, who is pursuing a masters in public health at Boston University, said social distancing is a no-brainer for her, no matter how difficult. Still, she said, she scrolls through Instagram, wistful and frustrated as less cautious acquaintances vacation and socialize.

She said an effective public health response would meet young people where they are.

“Being in your 20s is a very unique place in life. Some of us have families. Some of us have children. Some of us have responsibility for parents who are getting older. Some of us have been in school for 20 years. Some of us think because we’re younger, we’re immune to the virus," she said. “It’s more work to tailor the messages to fit those different groups, but regardless, everyone in the state — everyone in the country — deserves support.”

Former Harvard fencing coach, Maryland businessman charged in $1.5m college admissions bribery scheme

Harvard’s former fencing coach and a Maryland telecommunications executive were arrested by federal authorities Monday in an elaborate $1.5 million bribery scheme that allegedly secured the businessman’s sons entry into the school and spots on the vaunted fencing team.

Jie “Jack” Zhao, 61, of Potomac, Md., bought legendary fencing coach Peter Brand’s Needham house at an inflated price, renovated Brand’s new condo, paid his car loan and utility bills, and funneled other payments to Brand through nonprofit foundations, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in federal court in Boston.



In exchange, prosecutors said, Brand, 67, of Cambridge, promised spots on the school’s fencing team, and recruited both of Zhao’s sons, one of which entered Harvard in 2014, the other in 2017.

The federal charges marked the first time Harvard staff has been criminally implicated in the admissions scandal roiling campuses across the country. The alleged Harvard scam played out over several years, involving several men at the top of the rarefied sport, reaching into international fencing tournaments and a well-known training academy, while corrupting Harvard’s process for recruiting elite athletes.

“This case is part of our long-standing effort to expose and deter corruption in college admissions,” US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement. “Millions of teenagers strive for college admission every year. We will do our part to make that playing field as level as we possibly can.”

The federal charges follow a series of Boston Globe investigative reports that began last year, the first of which raised questions about Zhao’s purchase of Brand’s home at an inflated price, around the time of his younger son’s recruitment. Later, Globe stories revealed other financial transactions and text messages that allegedly outlined the recruitment scheme.

Following the reports, Harvard opened an investigation and ultimately fired Brand; the US attorney’s office for Massachusetts convened a federal grand jury.

The stories rocked the fencing community and dragged Harvard, for the first time, into an ongoing national college admissions scandal. But while Operation Varsity Blues involved resume-padding and inflated test scores, prosecutors portrayed the fencing recruitment scam as a more direct bribery scheme.

In an e-mail, Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane declined to comment.

Both men appeared in court Monday afternoon, Brand in Boston and Zhao in Maryland. A bearded Brand said little during the afternoon video proceeding and was later released on bond.

His attorney, Douglas Brooks, said in an e-mail that “Coach Brand did nothing wrong in connection with [the sons’] admission to Harvard. He looks forward to the truth coming out in court.”

An attorney for Zhao, multimillionaire cofounder of the global telecommunications company iTalk Global Communications Inc., said via e-mail that his client denies the charges. William D. Weinreb said Zhao’s sons were “academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit."

The scheme, according to prosecutors, stems from Brand’s desire for personal financial support, and Zhao’s yearning to have his sons attend Harvard.

The earliest seeds of the plot originated in 2012, when Brand came into the orbit of Zhao, whose older son at the time was a high school sophomore and an “accomplished fencer,” according to the federal complaint. The son trained at a fencing academy run by a man identified in court papers as “co-conspirator one,” who lives in Virginia and is now cooperating with authorities.

Though he wasn’t named in the court filings, the Globe has identified him as Alexandre Ryjik, the Soviet-trained head of the Virginia Academy of Fencing, where both of Zhao’s sons trained, and the president of the National Fencing Foundation, a nonprofit “dedicated to developing the personal character, academic achievement and athletic excellence through the world of fencing.”

An attorney for Ryjik, whose fencing academy has closed due to COVID-19, did not respond to an e-mail or phone call seeking comment. Phil Sbarbaro, an attorney on Ryjik’s foundation board, hung up on a reporter and did not respond to a subsequent e-mail. An inquiry to the foundation’s main mailbox went unanswered.

Prosecutors said the alleged co-conspirator told them that Zhao wanted his older son to attend Harvard.

Around that time, prosecutors allege, Brand and his wife, who worked for the city of Cambridge, had been having financial troubles and could “barely pay the bills,” according to an e-mail she sent him from her work account in February 2009.

Initially, Brand was allegedly noncommittal about recruiting him Zhao’s older son.

However, Brand texted Ryjik in May 2012 that Zhao’s sons “don’t have to be great fencers,” and that Brand just needed “a good incentive” to recruit the boys, according to messages reviewed by the Globe and later cited in the federal complaint. That text came less than two weeks after Brand’s wife had warned that the couple had “maxed out” their equity line of credit, the complaint said.

From there, the men allegedly hatched a plot that involved Zhao making a donation to Ryjik’s fencing charity, which would then make a donation to a nonprofit Brand was planning to start, prosecutors say. In February 2013, Zhao paid about $1 million to the National Fencing Foundation, the largest single payout the charity had ever received, by far.

Meanwhile, Brand and his wife started the Peter Brand Foundation.

Ultimately, prosecutors said, $100,000 was transferred from the fencing foundation to the Brand Foundation, and Zhao later began making direct payments to Brand.

Those payments allegedly included more than $8,000 toward Brand’s son’s college tuition; about $32,000 to pay the son’s educational loans; just over $119,000 toward the mortgage on Brand’s then-Needham home; about $2,500 for Brand’s water and sewer bill; and roughly $34,000 for a car loan, the complaint said.

Brand later helped facilitate the admission of Zhao’s younger son in the summer of 2016, according to prosecutors. Around the same time, Zhao agreed to buy Brand’s home for $989,500, more than $440,000 over the property’s assessed value.

The Needham assessor wrote in his notes that the sale of the Needham property made “NO SENSE.” Brand, for his part, subsequently purchased a $1.3 million apartment in Cambridge, offering $311,000 over asking price in what the realtor who represented the sellers later told the Globe was “a very aggressive offer.”

Zhao in July 2017 listed the Needham residence for $699,000, about $300,000 less than he bought it for. The home sold for $665,000.

In July 2019, following Globe reports, Harvard fired Brand. The school said an “independent investigation of the matter is now complete, and Mr. Brand has been dismissed from his position for violating Harvard’s conflict-of-interest policy.

The firing capped a sharp fall from the grace for the coach, who had arrived at the university in 1999 and propelled its beleaguered team from the bottom of the Ivy League rankings to the top, sending fencers to the Olympics and earning a cascade of “coach of the year” accolades. He regularly traveled to international tournaments, and had a strong reputation in the tight-knit fencing community.

But on Monday, he was released from federal custody on $500,000 bond, ordered to surrender any passports and avoid contact with Zhao, his alleged benefactor.

‘More people may die’: Biden urges Trump to aid transition





By STEVE PEOPLES AND ALEXANDRA JAFFE The Associated Press,Updated November 17, 2020, 1:25 a.m.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden warned of dire consequences if President Donald Trump and his administration continue to refuse to coordinate with his transition team on the coronavirus pandemic and block briefings on national security, policy issues and vaccine plans.

The remarks marked Biden's toughest to date on Trump's failure to acknowledge his election loss and cooperate with the incoming administration for a peaceful transfer of power.

“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters during a news conference Monday in Wilmington, Delaware.



Biden and his aides — and a small but growing group of Republicans — have emphasized the importance of being briefed on White House efforts to control the pandemic and distribute prospective vaccines. The Trump administration is working on its own distribution plan, while Biden’s chief of staff indicated his transition team will proceed with their own planning separately because of the obstruction.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it's “absolutely crucial that the apparent president-elect and his team have full access to the planning that has gone on” for vaccine distribution.

“It is no easy matter” to distribute a vaccine, Collins said, so “it’s absolutely imperative for public health, that all of the planning that’s gone on for which the current administration deserves credit, be shared with the new administration."

Collins' remarks were echoed Monday by Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Last week, a larger group of Republicans in Congress called on the Trump administration to allow Biden to begin receiving national security briefings.

The outgoing president has refused so far to bend to pressure from Democrats or Republicans as he continues to dispute his loss to Biden, who has surpassed the 270 electoral vote threshold to become president and is leading Trump by more than 5.5 million votes nationally.

Cooperation between the outgoing and incoming administrations, traditionally a key component to the peaceful transfer of power in the United States, takes on heightened significance this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, which is escalating dramatically heading into the holiday season.

Biden called the vaccine distribution a “huge, huge undertaking,” and said that if his team has to wait until he takes office to dig into the government’s distribution plan, they’ll be “behind, over a month, month and a half.”

Before taking questions, Biden outlined his plans to alleviate inequality and boost the U.S. economy but said that any structural reforms depended first on reining in the pandemic and delivering more immediate relief.

“Once we shut down the virus and deliver economic relief to workers and businesses, then we can start to build back better than before," he said.

Biden has vowed to spend trillions of dollars to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, expand health care coverage and combat climate change, among other priorities. But his chief priority remains controlling the pandemic, which is surging to record levels and forcing state and local leaders to implement new rounds of restrictions on local businesses.

The president-elect has so far tried to sidestep difficult questions about whether he might support a short-term national lockdown to arrest the surge of coronavirus cases. Since defeating Trump, Biden has devoted most of his public remarks to encouraging Americans to wear masks and embrace social distancing measures.

But members of his coronavirus advisory board have been more specific. One member, Michael Osterholm, recently suggested a four- to six-week national lockdown with financial aid for Americans whose livelihoods would be affected. He later walked back the remarks and was rebutted by two other members of the panel who said a widespread lockdown shouldn’t be under consideration.

Speaking Monday on “CBS This Morning,” Osterholm was not asked about a potential lockdown, but he said the nation needs “a standard set of principles.”

“Right now, we don’t have a standardized set so you’re hearing all these governors and mayors are scrambling to try to find what is the right answer for us, and it would surely help all of them, and that’s what I’m hearing from them, that we have a standardized set of recommendations and protocols,” he said.

Biden was asked Monday whether he would encourage leaders to look at potentially reinstating stay-at-home orders now that the pandemic is surging nationwide. He avoided answering directly and instead called on officials to embrace mask-wearing and criticized those who haven’t.

Before his Monday address, Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris held virtual meetings with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, General Motors CEO Mary Barra and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, among others.

The U.S. economy has recovered from the pandemic-induced shutdowns this spring more quickly than most economists expected. The unemployment rate dropped a full percentage point last month to 6.9% and those who still have jobs — many of them working from home — have stepped up their spending on cars, electronics and home renovations.

But much of the rebound was fueled by $2 trillion in stimulus money that has largely run its course. And there are signs that the ongoing increases in confirmed virus cases are making Americans more cautious about traveling and shopping.

Consumers cut back on spending in early November, according to JPMorgan Chase, which tracks spending on 30 million of its debit and credit cards. Spending declines have been larger in some states with severe outbreaks, such as Iowa and North Dakota.

Most economists support another round of stimulus funding, including loans to small businesses, extended unemployment benefits and support for states and cities. Congressional Democrats have previously backed another $2 trillion in aid.

Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has pointed to the falling unemployment rate as evidence that much less stimulus is needed.

But on whether Biden should receive coronavirus briefings, many of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill remained dug in.

“We’ve been working for the past year to make sure the vaccine will be delivered and it will be starting to be delivered probably in December, so he won’t even be president of the United States when the vaccine starts," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in pushing back against Biden's comments.

“He can be privy, but he won’t have anything to do with it," Cornyn said. "I mean, I hope by the time he’s inaugurated that we’re going to be well underway.”

Across the region, officials and passengers seek to put brakes on MBTA service cuts





By Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 7:04 p.m.

The MBTA’s proposed budget cuts have sparked an outcry from passengers and political leaders who say scaling back public transit will have both immediate and longer-term ramifications, hindering frontline workers while undercutting the region’s post-pandemic economic gains.

“I think the big problem is that these cuts are going to hurt the recovery as we think about moving forward," said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “And right now, these cuts are going to hurt the essential and frontline workers.” The two issues, he said, are of “equal” concern.

Walsh is part of a chorus of opposition to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s cash-saving plan that has emerged in recent days. Transit officials say the cutbacks are necessary to balance a budget thrown into deficit by collapsing revenue and are designed to minimize disruptions to riders on the busiest parts of the system.



But critics have said the cuts are shortsighted. At a rally near Mission Hill last week, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley decried the federal and state governments for “failing” T riders, while Hull town manager Philip Lemnios has called on the agency to raise fares rather than eliminate ferry service.

“I think they ought to be doing everything they can to make sure people can move in and around the Boston area, because that’s their primary function,” Lemnios said.

The MBTA’s proposal, unveiled last week, would reduce bus and train frequencies across most of the system, while ending service on the commuter rail after 9 p.m., eliminating weekend commuter rail trips, shuttering the ferry system, and shortening certain routes. The cuts would take effect next year, mostly between spring and summer.

The MBTA stressed that the plan is not final and noted that the agency is holding more than a dozen hearings about the reductions before its oversight board votes on the plan in December.

“The MBTA is carrying out a comprehensive outreach process as it wants public feedback and will take it seriously,” general manager Steve Poftak said in a statement.

Under the proposal, officials expect to save about $128 million next fiscal year, marking one of several measures to plug a budget gap that could exceed $575 million as the agency reels from a massive decline in fare revenue during the pandemic.

Transit agencies and advocates have called on Congress to help stave off cuts, but negotiations on a coronavirus relief bill have stalled.

Walsh suggested Massachusetts lawmakers dip into the state’s rainy day fund to avoid some cuts. The House of Representatives last week passed a budget plan for the ongoing fiscal year that did not increase MBTA funding in order to close its deficit. The Senate budget up for debate this week does not either, though a proposed amendment would increase MBTA funding by about $300 million.

Although MBTA officials have described the cuts as a “last resort,” they have also said they may move forward with many of the changes even if a federal or state funding package is approved. The cuts are justified in part by the low number of riders using most of the system, they said.

But those riders depend on the system and may struggle to get around if service is cut, said Brockton Mayor Robert Sullivan.

“Some work late shifts or early morning shifts,” Sullivan said. The city’s commuter rail stations "are not being as used as much during the pandemic, I recognize that, but there are going to be many workers who can’t find reliable transit to get into their jobs.”

Willie Faye Clay, 63, lives near the Heath Street Green Line stop at the border of Jamaica Plain and Mission Hill. The MBTA’s plan to end the Green Line five stops earlier at Brigham Circle, saving $2 million, will make it more difficult to run errands, she said.

“It’s not that many stops from Brigham Circle to Heath Street,” said Clay, who uses a wheelchair and says it’s harder to take the bus. “I think they should consider the impact of how it would affect people.”

Meanwhile, the timing of the cuts could backfire if a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available and commuters begin returning to work in the spring or summer.

While work and travel habits may well be different in the pandemic’s aftermath, the end of the public health crisis would undoubtedly increase daily trips into and around Boston. Reduced transit service could also exacerbate Boston traffic, further hampering the economy and creating more fuel emissions.

“I’m already looking into it, because the writing is on the wall, but I’m looking into buying a car and paying for parking,” said Brenda Connors, who lives in Hull and has taken the ferry to her job as a dental assistant in Boston throughout the pandemic.

MBTA officials have said the eliminated services can resume as ridership and fare revenue rebound, but the agency’s own presentation materials say it could take up to two years to hire and train drivers to operate the restored trips. And officials have so far struggled to clearly explain how they’ll know it’s time to bring back closed services except by monitoring ridership on other parts of the system and public feedback over time.

“I wish there was an easier answer, so that we can say ‘if you do A, B, and C, we will be in a position where we will be bringing that particular route back,'" MBTA deputy general manager Jeff Gonneville said at a virtual public meeting last week, responding to a question from a rider. “Admittedly, this is something we are hearing a fair amount."

Here’s what you need to know about the Moderna vaccine announcement





By Kay Lazar and Jonathan Saltzman Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 1:49 p.m.

The coronavirus vaccine developed by Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. made headlines Monday. Here is a quick rundown on what you need to know:

What’s today’s news?

Moderna said Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine had proven highly effective at preventing coronavirus infections, in the first glimpse of data from its late-stage clinical trial. The news offered another glimmer of light at the end of the coronavirus pandemic tunnel, though experts are still warning there are some deadly and depressing months ahead as cases rise nationwide.



What about the Pfizer vaccine?

This is the second piece of good news regarding vaccines in recent days. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer reported a week ago that its vaccine candidate was also highly effective. More vaccines may also be on the way: There are a dozen coronavirus vaccine candidates in late-stage trials globally.

How excited should we get?

Cautious optimism is in order. Both Moderna and Pfizer still need to complete their large-scale trials involving thousands of participants. The data released so far are interim results that do not answer key questions, including how long protection against infection might last. Consider that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in self-quarantine after being in contact with someone with COVID-19. Back in April, Johnson was hospitalized in intensive care with the virus. “It’s not common, but we have seen sporadic examples of people who have been infected a second time, and we don’t know if that will be the exception or the rule,” said Michael Kinch, director of the Centers for Research Innovation in Biotechnology & Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.

The two-dose vaccines also will be logistically challenging to distribute to millions of people. And the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at super-cold temperatures.

When will people get the shots?

Both Moderna and Pfizer say they expect to complete more testing and submit their results to federal regulators in the coming weeks for emergency use approval, and both have said they expect to start shipping out millions of doses before the end of the year. But so far, most experts believe there will only be enough to target health care workers, people in elder care facilities, and those with underlying health conditions first.

Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, said Monday on NBC’s “Today” show, “We project that by the end of December, that there will be doses of vaccines available for individuals in the higher-risk category, from both companies, we hope, and this is something that we’re looking forward to.” He said “we want to really get the ball rolling as we get into January, February, and March.”

Fauci said last week he expected vaccines to be more widely available in April.

The Moderna vaccine doesn’t need to be kept at super-cold temperatures. Is that a game-changer?

Moderna now says its vaccine candidate remains stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 days, up from the company’s previous estimate of seven days. And it remains stable for up to six months in a freezer set at minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit. Pfizer’s candidate needs to remain in super-cold storage — roughly minus-103 Fahrenheit — until ready for use, raising concerns about sufficient capacity of super-cold refrigeration units to safely deliver and store millions of doses around the world.

So the Moderna news will make a measurable difference, said Dr. Karen Tashima, director of clinical trials in the Immunology Center at the Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island. “We don’t want to waste vaccine if it’s been sitting in the refrigerator for 8 days. We don’t want to have to throw it out,” she said. “Now we have 30 days. People will feel a lot better about that.”

Will we get to choose which vaccine we receive?

It may depend on refrigeration. If Moderna’s vaccine gets the OK soon, it is expected to be more widely available to areas without super-cold storage capacity, compared with Pfizer’s vaccine. “The big cities that have access to deep freezers clustered around academic research centers, there you would probably use the Pfizer vaccine, whereas in the rural areas, or away from the medical centers, you would presumably want to utilize your warmer-temperature vaccine," Kinch said.

Are young people to blame for recent COVID-19 surges? Experts say the numbers are not conclusive


An increasing share of the state’s COVID cases are in people under 30, but other age groups have been infected at similar rates.


By Dasia Moore Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:54 p.m.



“There’s this kind of ever-looming fear on our campus of if someone gets caught [breaking a pandemic rule], they don’t know what’s going to happen," said Soraya Pierre-Louis, 22, a fifth-year biology student at Northeastern University.Erin Clark / Globe Staff





As COVID-19 once again grips the Northeast and the country, the message to twenty-somethings in particular has been consistent and clear: Get serious. Stop partying. You are endangering your communities.

Across the country and the world, young adults are making up an ever-increasing share of known COVID-19 cases, and public officials are not letting the trend go unnoticed.

In a recent overhaul of its daily dashboard, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health began highlighting the age breakdown of new cases, increasingly skewed toward young adults. Governor Charlie Baker — along with leaders across the region — has repeatedly admonished young people for flouting pandemic rules, pointing to house parties and other risky gatherings as drivers of the current surge.



But epidemiologists worry that officials' reprimands might be misdirected — and counterproductive.

“It may very well be true that small social gatherings or large social gatherings among young people are driving the pandemic, but I haven’t yet seen data to support that,” said Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.

Though infection rates have risen rapidly among young adults, Marcus and other experts warn that data explaining that trend are limited. Young people themselves say some of their peers may remedy isolation in irresponsible ways, but the social and economic realities of early adulthood also increase their risk: service industry work, reliance on public transit, crowded housing that helps lower costs but increases their exposure.

Regardless of why certain age groups are contracting COVID-19 — at work or parties, due to their recklessness or responsibilities — scientists said public officials should use compassion, not shame, to inform policy and curb infections.

“We know from other areas of public health, with HIV and substance use, that blaming people for their risky health behavior is not just ineffective, it can also be counterproductive,” Marcus said. “It perpetuates stigma, which drives people away from public health rather than engaging them, which is what we really want to do.”





The 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts has been over 1,000 since Oct. 24, marking the longest stretch since May with such high levels.

While all age groups have seen numbers rise throughout most of the late summer and fall, people in their 20s saw the highest rates of new probable and confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, data from the Public Health Department’s weekly reports show. In the past two weeks, 4,600 people aged 20-29 have tested positive for the disease.

Other working-age adults also have infection rates that exceed the state average. In recent weeks, rates among thirty-somethings have nearly kept pace with those among twenty-somethings, with people in their 40s not far behind. The distribution of cases has shifted dramatically since spring, with most reported cases showing up in people under 50 today, versus elders earlier in the pandemic.

“Our young people need to be serious about dealing with COVID,” Baker said in an October press conference. “COVID is a very contagious virus, and it will rear its ugly head wherever it gets the chance.”





Experts said there is good reason to be concerned about rising cases in young adults, as COVID-19 can be fatal for people of any age and the long-term effects of milder infections remain unknown.

Young people can also seed infection in their communities, said Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “We’re seeing the same pattern here [in the United States] that we’ve seen in Europe and other places, which is you see cases expand in the younger age groups, but then it’s followed by cases in older age groups and vulnerable populations,” she said.





The question of why young adults are getting infected is more complicated, experts said.

“I think there’s a tendency to envision that there are all these young people out at bars and parties, and that somehow it is irresponsible behavior [driving cases],” said Dr. Sarah Fortune, chair of the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “I do not think the data per se can be interpreted to mean that.”

The same “overlapping social-political factors” that contribute to COVID-19 risk among the general population also apply to young people, she said.

For Maggie Timboe, 22, and Curt Mai, 21, what they see as the riskiest part of their routines is also the most necessary: Going to work.

Timboe, a food service worker, restricts her social circle to her boyfriend, with whom she lives in Allston, and four or five friends she only meets outdoors. She said she feels safe in her workplace but worries about contracting COVID-19 during her hourlong commute on the T.

“Mostly the experience [of the pandemic] has been the anxiety about traveling to work,” she said. “And really, in the last two weeks, the anxiety has gotten worse.”

“I’m a restaurant manager. Probably I interact with 1,000 customers a week,” said Mai, who lives with two roommates in Lowell. “I have no choice. That’s what I have to do to pay my bills, you know?”

Mai said he believed that in addition to service industry work, people his age are also put at risk by a “you only live once” mindset that leads some to throw caution — and their communities' health — to the wind, even though he said he and his friends take COVID-19 seriously.

Several young people voiced similar concerns about their peers more broadly, while insisting that they and the people they know are being careful. All balked at the idea that partying is driving infections. Several of the activities they think other young people are irresponsible for doing — dining in groups, going to the gym, traveling between states, taking public transit for leisure outings — are, in fact, allowed and deemed safe by officials.

“That people take their lead from the government is natural,” said one 32-year-old in Cambridge who has struggled to find common ground on pandemic safety with his roommate, who spends time in settings he thinks are unsafe, including gyms. He asked to stay anonymous out of concern that his roommate, the one person he sees regularly, would be upset.

Reopening “puts more undue burden on the individual” to determine what is safe, he said.

Soraya Pierre-Louis, a 22-year-old Northeastern University student, said that burden has been a defining feature of her senior year in college. Pierre-Louis plans to pursue a career in public health, in part because of the pandemic. But even for rule-followers like herself, she said, “There’s this kind of ever-looming fear on our campus of if someone gets caught [breaking a pandemic rule], they don’t know what’s going to happen."

Pervasive fear will not keep young people, or anyone, from taking risks, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist. But she said empathy might.

“We’re telling people to stay home as much as possible, but we have to recognize that that’s easier for some people than others,” Nuzzo said. “For someone in their early 20s who potentially doesn’t have a built-in social unit at home, their one source of social support is their friends.

“I say that not to absolve people but just to be realistic about what it’s going to take to control this virus,” she said.

“If we take a minute before yelling at people to actually ask why are people gathering right now, the answer is probably going to be that they need social connection,” said Marcus, the Harvard epidemiologist who studies stigma. “Once we can see what that unmet need is, we can help people find safer ways to do that.”

Alexandria Whitted, 22, has resorted to making new friends at the grocery store, one of the few places she ventures since moving to Brookline from North Carolina in August. Whitted, who is pursuing a masters in public health at Boston University, said social distancing is a no-brainer for her, no matter how difficult. Still, she said, she scrolls through Instagram, wistful and frustrated as less cautious acquaintances vacation and socialize.

She said an effective public health response would meet young people where they are.

“Being in your 20s is a very unique place in life. Some of us have families. Some of us have children. Some of us have responsibility for parents who are getting older. Some of us have been in school for 20 years. Some of us think because we’re younger, we’re immune to the virus," she said. “It’s more work to tailor the messages to fit those different groups, but regardless, everyone in the state — everyone in the country — deserves support.”

‘More people may die’: Biden urges Trump to aid transition

Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, has pointed to the falling unemployment rate as evidence that much less stimulus is needed.

But on whether Biden should receive coronavirus briefings, many of Trump's allies on Capitol Hill remained dug in.

“We’ve been working for the past year to make sure the vaccine will be delivered and it will be starting to be delivered probably in December, so he won’t even be president of the United States when the vaccine starts," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in pushing back against Biden's comments.

“He can be privy, but he won’t have anything to do with it," Cornyn said. "I mean, I hope by the time he’s inaugurated that we’re going to be well underway.”

Trump will order troop reductions in Afghanistan, Iraq





By LOLITA C. BALDOR Associated Press,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:35 p.m.



The White House is expected to cut the number of US troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15.John Moore/Getty Images via Bloomberg





The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of US troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, officials said Monday. The order would stop short of outgoing President Trump’s goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.

The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500.

The decisions come as no surprise, following Trump’s shakeup of the Pentagon leadership last week, when he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The cuts give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede he lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden.



The officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are 4,500 to 5,000 troops in Afghanistan and more than 3,000 in Iraq.

The troop cuts would be completed just five days before Biden takes office, leaving him with a smaller military footprint in the two key war zones. Military commanders have expressed less concern about pulling troops from Iraq, where the Iraqi forces are better able to maintain their nation’s security.

Trump’s new Pentagon chief, Christopher Miller, hinted at the troop withdrawals over the weekend in a carefully worded message to the force that suggested compromise.

He said that “we remain committed to finishing the war that Al Qaida brought to our shores in 2001.” And he warned that “we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish.”

But he also made it clear that “all wars must end.”

“This fight has been long, our sacrifices have been enormous. and many are weary of war — I’m one of them,” he said. “Ending wars requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now, it’s time to come home.”

The accelerated withdrawal, however, goes against the longstanding advice from Trump’s military leadership, including Marine General Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East. But officials suggested this week that commanders will be able to live with the partial pullout, which allows them to keep counterterrorism troops in Afghanistan and gives more time to remove critical equipment.

McKenzie and others have repeatedly argued that a hasty withdrawal could undercut negotiations to finalize ongoing peace negotiations between the Taliban and representatives of Afghan society, including the current Afghan government. And they warn that US forces should remain in the country to keep the Islamic State group’s militants in check.

Biden has sounded less absolute about troop withdrawal. He has said some troops could stay in Afghanistan to focus on counterterrorism. In response to a questionnaire before the election, he said: "Americans are rightly weary of our longest war; I am, too. But we must end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back.''

The expected order adds to what has been a litany of muddled White House and Pentagon messages on troop withdrawals, exacerbating what has been an emotional roller coaster for the troops and their families.

The Pentagon was already on track to cut troops levels in Afghanistan to about 4,500 by mid-November. US military leaders have consistently said that going below that number must be based on conditions on the ground, including a measurable reduction in attacks by the Taliban on Afghan troops. And they insist they have not seen that yet.

America’s exit from Afghanistan after 19 years was laid out in a February agreement Washington reached with the Taliban. It said US troops would be out of Afghanistan in 18 months, provided the Taliban honored a commitment to fight terrorist groups, with most attention seemingly focused on the Islamic State group’s affiliate in the country.

Military officials also have warned that there is a large amount of critical, classified equipment at bases in Afghanistan that needs to be removed, but it will take more time. And they say that any full US withdrawal needs to be coordinated with other allies that have troops in the country.

The White House, however, issued a confusing series of statements about Afghanistan over the past month. Trump on Oct. 7 tweeted that “we should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas.” Asked about those comments, Robert O’Brien, his national security adviser, said Trump was just expressing a hope.

Trump administration rushes to auction off rights to oil drilling in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge





By Juliet Eilperin Washington Post,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:28 p.m.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has called for oil and gas companies to pick spots where they want to drill in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as it races to open the pristine wilderness to development and lock in drilling rights before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.

The ''call for nominations,'' to be published Tuesday, allows companies to identify tracts to bid on during an upcoming lease sale on the refuge’s nearly 1.6-million-acre coastal plain, a sale that the Interior Department aims to hold before Biden takes the oath of office Jan. 20. The move would be a capstone of President Trump’s efforts to open up public lands to logging, mining, and grazing — something Biden strongly opposes.



A GOP-controlled Congress in 2017 authorized drilling in the refuge, a vast wilderness that is home to tens of thousands of migrating caribou and waterfowl, along with polar bears and Arctic foxes.

''Receiving input from industry on which tracts to make available for leasing is vital in conducting a successful lease sale,'' said Chad Badgett, the Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska state director, in a statement. ''This call for nominations brings us one step closer to holding a historic first Coastal Plain lease sale, satisfying the directive of Congress in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and advancing this administration’s policy of energy independence.''

The administration is pressing ahead with other moves to expand energy development and scale back federal environmental rules. It aims to finalize a plan to open up the vast majority of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to drilling, as well as adopt a narrower definition of what constitutes critical habitat for endangered species and when companies are liable for killing migratory birds.

At the Energy Department, officials may weaken energy-efficiency requirements for showerheads before Inauguration Day.

It is unclear how much appetite there is in the oil and gas industry for drilling in the refuge, given the lack of infrastructure there and the public backlash that could accompany such a move. The area provides habitat for more than 270 species, including the world’s remaining Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears, 250 musk oxen, and 300,000 snow geese.

Gwich’in Steering Committee executive director Bernadette Demientieff, whose people have traveled with the caribou on the refuge for thousands of years, said in a statement: ''Any company thinking about participating in this corrupt process should know that they will have to answer to the Gwich’in people and the millions of Americans who stand with us. We have been protecting this place forever.''

But smaller players might be willing to bid on leases, which would be difficult to claw back once they are finalized. Some Alaska Native tribal corporations have expressed an interest in conducting seismic tests to identify oil reserves on the coastal plain, and they aim to complete that work this winter.

Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an interview Friday that the administration is operating ''under a tight timeline,'' but he added that many Alaskans support drilling in the refuge and that the 2017 law gives officials a solid legal basis for moving forward.

''Our view is that Congress has acted,'' Macchiarola said. ''Production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a long time coming. It’s overdue, and it’s important to our nation’s energy security.''

Drilling in the refuge has been an ideological litmus test for more than a generation, and environmentalists have pressed major financial institutions not to back it even as it creeps closer to becoming a reality. Some major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have announced they will not finance projects in the refuge.

On Monday, the Oslo-based energy research firm Rystad Energy published an analysis saying that going forward, ''companies will be less willing to drill high-risk wells in environmentally sensitive frontier areas, both for financial and environmental reasons. As a result, the full petroleum potential of areas like the Alaskan Arctic, Foz do Amazonas in Brazil and the Barents Sea may never be unlocked.''

The Bureau of Land Management will hold a 30-day comment period once the call for nominations is published Tuesday. Once that period closes, the agency could publish a lease sale notice, which must be published 30 days before an auction takes place. Under that timeline, drilling rights could be sold before Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.

Several environmental groups are challenging the administration’s overall oil and gas leasing program for the refuge in four separate lawsuits. If one of those challenges prevails, it could effectively void the leases.

Eric Grafe, deputy managing attorney for the Alaska office of Earthjustice, said in an e-mail that the leases could be in jeopardy for other reasons, as well. It often takes several weeks to process bids, because the Bureau of Land Management must screen the highest bids for ethical and legal issues before issuing contracts. If the agency holds an auction but doesn’t finalize the leases before Biden’s inauguration, ''the new administration may be able to avoid issuing them, particularly if it concludes the program or lease sale was unlawfully adopted.''

''Even if leases are issued by the Trump administration, the Biden administration could seek to withdraw the leases if it concludes they were unlawfully issued or pose too great a threat to the environment,'' he said, adding that the leaseholders could then argue they deserve financial compensation if the leases are invalidated.

The cities central to fraud conspiracy theories didn’t cost Trump the election





By Emily Badger New York Times,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:07 p.m.



Temporary employees of the City Commissioner's office wearing protective masks counted votes at a convention center for the 2020 Presidential election in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020.Bloomberg/Photographer: Bloomberg/Bloomber





In Pennsylvania, much of President Trump’s attention since the election has focused on Philadelphia, where he has baselessly insisted there is a “mountain of corruption.” In Michigan, litigation by Trump’s campaign has concentrated on Detroit, where Republican poll watchers say they felt intimidated by election workers in Black Lives Matter apparel. And in Wisconsin, legal challenges and rumors have circled around Milwaukee, where one Internet conspiracy theory turns on a briefly misplaced flash drive of election results.

That these three cities would become the chief sites of Republican claims of fraud in this election is unsurprising. All three are heavily Democratic. They have large Black populations. And in their respective states, they have long been targets of racialized charges of corruption.



But in one revealing way, the fixation this year is misplaced. All three cities voted pretty much the same way they did in 2016. Turnout barely budged, relative to other areas in these states. Joe Biden saw no remarkable surge in support — certainly nothing that would bolster claims of ballot stuffing or tampered vote tallies. Trump even picked up marginally more votes this year in all three cities than he did four years ago.

Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit, in other words, were not decisive in explaining why the Northern battleground states flipped from Trump four years ago to Biden in 2020. Voters outside of these cities made the difference.

But the president and his allies have said little about those voters — in places like the Milwaukee suburbs of Ozaukee County, or in predominantly white Kent County, Mich.

“From a partisan perspective, Trump’s vilification of cities makes no sense,” Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in an e-mail. “It has little to do with his loss in Wisconsin, which resulted mostly from small shifts in the white vote outside of the city, particularly the suburbs, Dane County, and other parts of Milwaukee County.”

Instead, Burden said, the president appears to be practicing thinly veiled race-baiting, by blaming communities of color for his loss.

Michigan’s attorney general, Dana Nessel, concluded the same in criticizing lawsuits brought by the president’s campaign and allies.

“Really the themes that we see, that persist, are this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent and Black people can’t be trusted,” Nessel said during a call with reporters last week.

These cities did prove central to Trump’s defeat in more symbolic ways.

Biden’s vote count in Wisconsin jumped in the middle of the night after Election Day when the city of Milwaukee completed its count of mail-in ballots about 3:30 a.m. That helped explain why many Americans woke up Wednesday morning to a different picture of the race in Wisconsin.

In Michigan, the TCF Center in Detroit became a center of pro-Trump protests as election workers tallied votes in the city and as Biden’s lead continued to grow on the Friday after the election.

And in Pennsylvania, it was a tabulation of votes in Philadelphia on Saturday that pushed Biden across the threshold where many media outlets were prepared to call the state — and the election — for him. Philadelphia, too, was the scene of some of the most raucous celebrations that followed.

In the unofficial results, however, these cities shifted little from 2016 in their vote tallies for the Democrat, unlike many surrounding suburbs. And Trump picked up about 3,000 additional votes in Milwaukee, about 5,000 in Detroit, and about 21,000 in Philadelphia, in counts that are not yet completed.

Part of what makes these cities perennial targets is their size, said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University. Because of that, they’re slower to count ballots, feeding suspicions about late-changing results. And if a campaign is looking to narrow vote margins through litigation, it makes more sense to go after the county with half a million voters than one with only a few hundred.

But Gillespie said the racial implications of these fraud claims would not be lost on Black voters.

“In one minute, he’s talking about how he’s the greatest president for Black people since Abraham Lincoln, which is historically inaccurate,” she said. “And then in the next breath, you now are trying to disqualify voters in cities with large Black populations, in ways that look like disenfranchisement and voter suppression.”

Recent lawsuits in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin proposed doing exactly that — excluding millions of votes cast in these large urban centers (including Atlanta) from vote totals in these states. Those legal challenges have all fallen flat. But they’re notable for how literally they embraced the common partisan claim that urban votes shouldn’t count as much as votes from rural America — that Republicans win Wisconsin, if you just take away Milwaukee and Madison; that Trump wins the popular vote, if you just lop off California and New York.

Such arguments about fraud are clearly alluring for many Americans. Political science research suggests that resentment of immigrants and minorities is correlated with beliefs about voter fraud, said Nyron Crawford, a professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. Once you believe Black Americans or immigrants are more likely to be corrupt or criminal, it’s not such a stretch to believe their communities steal elections.

“It’s easier to lay those claims if you already harbor some resentment toward the group,” Crawford said.

It would be harder to argue there’s something fishy about the entire eastern half of Pennsylvania, where counties of all kinds shifted toward Biden this year.

Trump campaign jettisons major parts of its legal challenge against Pennsylvania’s election results





By Jon Swaine and Elise Viebeck Washington Post,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:26 p.m.

WASHINGTON — President Trump’s campaign on Sunday scrapped a major part of its federal lawsuit challenging the election results in Pennsylvania.

Trump’s attorneys filed a revised version of the lawsuit, removing allegations that election officials violated the Trump campaign’s constitutional rights by limiting the ability of their observers to watch votes being counted.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, have said repeatedly that more than 600,000 votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh should be invalidated because of this issue.



Trump’s pared-down lawsuit now focuses on allegations that Republicans were illegally disadvantaged because some Democratic-leaning counties allowed voters to fix errors on their mail ballots. Counties have said this affected only a small number of votes.

Cliff Levine, an attorney representing the Democratic Party in the case, said on Sunday evening that Trump’s move meant his lawsuit could not possibly change the result.

''Now you’re only talking about a handful of ballots,'' said Levine. ''They would have absolutely no impact on the total count or on Joe Biden’s win over Donald Trump.''

Kathy Boockvar, Pennsylvania’s Democratic secretary of state, submitted a court filing in response to the Trump campaign’s actions reiterating her request for the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

The shift comes amid a string of losses in the Trump campaign’s post-election legal effort, which claimed without evidence that voter fraud, irregularities, and rule-breaking led to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Taken together, the flurry of post-election litigation has affirmed the integrity of the election: many of the complaints have been tossed, and not a single vote has been invalidated.

The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment Sunday evening. Earlier in the day, Trump suggested that his legal challenges to the election results would continue to come.

''Many of the court cases being filed all over the Country are not ours, but rather those of people that have seen horrible abuses,'' he said in a tweet. ''Our big cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election, & the outrage of things that were done to change the outcome, will soon be filed!''

But even as the campaign continued filing appeals in other Pennsylvania cases on Sunday night, the withdrawal of one of its most aggressive claims curtails a central part of its effort to fend off the certification of the vote in the state.

The revised filing came on a day when Trump reiterated his intention not to concede the election to Biden, moments after seeming to acknowledge the results of the Nov. 3 election. Biden won the popular vote and was projected the winner of the race, having received 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232. States are still certifying the results.

Suits challenging the election results dropped in four states





Updated November 16, 2020, 6:02 p.m.

The plaintiffs in four federal lawsuits around the country challenging the integrity of the presidential election all filed notice Monday morning that they were dropping their cases.

In a coordinated move, the filings — in Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — came in rapid succession within less than an hour.

The cases were similarly structured: All had been filed by ordinary voters who claimed that the certification of the vote in key counties in their states should be halted because of election improprieties.



Each of them was overseen by James Bopp Jr., a conservative lawyer and former top official at the Republican National Committee. In a brief interview Monday, Bopp declined to comment on the suits, saying that he did not want to telegraph his strategy if he ultimately chose to file more cases.

Neither the Trump campaign nor Republican officials were parties in these particular suits, though President Trump has urged his supporters to challenge an election that he has repeatedly claimed, without substantial evidence, was the result of widespread fraud.

The campaign, Republican organizations, and individual voters have cumulatively filed nearly two dozen suits in at least seven states that have failed so far to stop either the counting of votes or the certification of results. But the barrage of legal action challenging President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory is not over.

Federal suits are still working their way through courts in Michigan, in Georgia, and in Pennsylvania, where a judge in Williamsport is expected to hold a hearing on Tuesday. The Trump campaign also filed an appeal on Monday of a state court suit it lost in Michigan last week. And Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, who is leading the post-election legal battle, has promised further suits.

NEW YORK TIMES





Most votes in Georgia have been recounted

ATLANTA — Roughly two-thirds of the 5 million ballots cast in Georgia’s presidential race have been recounted by hand as of Monday morning, with local elections officials reporting few problems and Democrats saying that the recount so far has not substantially changed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s lead over President Trump.

Over the weekend, election officials said that roughly 50 of the state’s 159 counties had finished their recounts. All must complete recounting by Wednesday night.

Election officials declined Monday to release the results from individual counties. But Patrick Moore, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, said that Democrats had been keeping tabs on the county results and that only minor discrepancies had turned up.

Obama urges GOP to honor ‘electoral process’

Michelle Obama suggested President Trump was treating the transition like “a game” on Monday and pleaded with Republicans to “honor the electoral process” by accepting Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the president-elect.

“Our democracy is so much bigger than anybody’s ego,” Obama, the former first lady, wrote on Instagram, as she called out the president for “spreading racist lies” about her husband.

Obama, one of the most popular women in the world and an influential figure in the Democratic Party, began her post by recounting how painful it had been to acknowledge that Trump had won in 2016.

Trump, she said, had spread the racist birther lie that “had put my family in danger” — but she was determined to follow the protocols of respect, cooperation, and support that former President George W. Bush and his family adopted after President Barack Obama was elected.

“This isn’t a game,” she wrote, addressing the president’s followers, and Republican leaders who have placated Trump by refusing to acknowledge Biden’s status as president-elect.

“So I want to urge all Americans, especially our nation’s leaders, regardless of party, to honor the electoral process and do your part to encourage a smooth transition of power, just as sitting presidents have done throughout our history.”

On Sunday night her husband said during a ''60 Minutes'' interview that it was time for President Trump to concede.

''A president is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the office, by design,'' Barack Obama told correspondent Scott Pelley. ''And when your time is up, then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments.''

''My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it’s time for you to do the same thing,'' Obama said.

His remarks amounted to the former president’s most forceful statement yet condemning Trump’s failure to respect a peaceful transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden. During a wide-ranging interview, Obama also criticized Republicans ''who clearly know better'' for allowing Trump’s false claims of election fraud to go unchecked.

NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST

Top Trump adviser acknowledges Biden win

Robert O’Brien, President Trump’s national security adviser, acknowledged Monday that it “obviously” looks as though Joe Biden has won the election, and he promised “a very professional transition” on the National Security Council.

Speaking at the Global Security Forum, O’Brien left open the possibility that Trump could still prevail if courts determine there was widespread fraud, but he struck a markedly different tone than the president and several of his staunchest allies.

“If there is a new administration, they deserve some time to come in and implement their policies,” O’Brien said. “We may have policy disagreements, but, look, if the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner — obviously, things look that way now — we’ll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council. There’s no question about it.”

WASHINGTON POST

Wisconsin says recount would cost $7.9m

The Wisconsin Elections Commission said the cost of running a statewide recount for the presidential election will be $7.9 million — a fee that Trump’s campaign would be required to pay upfront if he wishes to request a recount in the state.

Under Wisconsin law, the state will pay for a recount if one candidate wins by 0.25 percent or less. When the threshold of victory is under 1 percent, however, the losing candidate can request a recount — provided they agree to pay in advance. Unofficial results show Biden defeated Trump in Wisconsin by about 20,500 votes, or 0.6 percent.

By state law, Wisconsin counties must complete a canvass of local results by Tuesday. The Trump campaign will have until 5 p.m. Wednesday to submit a petition asking for a statewide recount, and the $7.9 million payment.

Asked if the campaign would pay the fee and seek the recount, Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser to the Trump campaign, said, “The legal team continues to examine the issues with irregularities in Wisconsin and are leaving all legal options open, including a recount and an audit.”

The campaign has identified no specific irregularities in Wisconsin.

Besieged Peruvian congress picks ex-World Bank man as president





By John Quigley Bloomberg,Updated November 17, 2020, 2:00 a.m.

Faced with violent protests and political chaos, Peru’s besieged congress chose a U.S.-trained engineer and systems analyst to be the nation’s president — the third in less than a week — in a bid to restore some measure of calm.

Lawmakers on Monday voted in Francisco Sagasti, an elder-statesman legislator with extensive consulting experience at home and abroad to lead a new government by electing him head of congress.

Sagasti, 76, who has a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, is a former head of strategic planning at the World Bank and a one-time adviser to the United Nations on science and technology. Although he’s been a lawmaker only eight months, he’s seen as a conciliatory figure and corruption-free in a fractured and volatile congress, half of whose members have been accused of a crime.



After being sworn in, Sagasti said he’d seek to heal an anguished nation through fairness and justice.

“The protests were a powerful wake-up call,” he said. “The pandemic, the economic crisis, the problems with security weren’t enough. We had to wait for the death of two young men to realize the ignominy of the situation we’re living in.”

“For a long time he’s dreamed of becoming president,” said Miguel Jaramillo, a researcher at the Lima-based Grade think tank, which Sagasti co-founded. “He’s better qualified for the post than anyone else in congress and better placed to convince competent technocrats to take over public administration until next July.”

Sagasti’s predecessor, Manuel Merino, assumed the presidency last week following the surprise impeachment of Martin Vizcarra, just five months before the country’s next general election. After demonstrators flooded the streets of Lima, where two people were shot dead, Merino quit on Sunday.

Merino, his cabinet chief and interior minister are now under investigation by the office of the attorney general for the two deaths and abuse of authority.

As head of congress, Merino led the impeachment of Vizcarra, one of the most popular politicians in the country, in what many saw as a naked power grab. Vizcarra had the backing of much of the nation but butted heads with the legislature — his party has no members in it — in a dynamic that has paralyzed Peruvian politics.

Sagasti’s Purple Party is the only one in congress to have voted squarely against Vizcarra’s ouster.

Sagasti has opposed congressional economic proposals considered dangerous by the government, such as a large cash payout from the state retirement fund. He was on the ticket with a leftist lawmaker, Mirtha Vasquez, who’ll become acting head of congress.

Peru has long been a paradox — wild politics and endless corruption allegations but solid economic and market opportunities. The coming and going of numerous presidents has rarely affected investment basics.

But on Monday, its currency, the sol, declined to a record low. It and other assets will respond positively to Sagasti’s appointment, according to David Tuesta, who served as the nation’s finance minister in 2018.

“He was the best choice from this very precarious congress,” Tuesta said. Still, “market volatility will remain until the cabinet is known.”

Others said the selection would strengthen institutions shaken not only by this infighting but by Covid-19 and the deep economic challenges it has brought to Peru.

“Francisco won’t do anything to jeopardize a democratic transition,” said Carlos Penny, a veteran banker who taught at Universidad del Pacifico at the same time as Sagasti. “I think he’ll be cautious in making sure the process is smooth. He’s a thoughtful person, who’s not impulsive.”

Jo-Marie Burt, a Latin America specialist at George Mason University, said what happened in the past week reflected the raw nature of Peru’s politics. Vizcarra had sought reforms, including term limits and an end to parliamentary immunity, that many in congress found threatening.

“There is a coalition in congress that act on their very personal, private interest to maintain their seats in parliament, their parliamentary immunity, to be able to run in the next government and keep access to government funds,” she said.

She added, “Peruvians understood what was going on and protested massively. They want to put an end to this conspiracy of ‘to the victor goes the spoils.’”

The speed with which congress installed a new president was an indication that its members understood the public was feeling betrayed and furious. Demonstrations continued on Monday throughout the voting.

Nicolas Urrutia, a senior analyst at Control Risks, put it this way: “When you boil it down to its simplest elements, you have a very unpopular congress led by a second or third degree politician that ousted the most popular head of state in 20 years.”

In his statement after being sworn in, Sagasti made clear that the divide between congress and the people had to be bridged. He said the “country wants to be recognized and to be able to say ‘that congress represents me.’”

After the ceremony, Sagasti went outside to the street in front of congress to wave, and hold up a clenched fist to demonstrators. He’ll be sworn in as interim president on Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking to journalists, he added, “It’s not a time for celebration. We have too many problems and difficulties. It’s a moment of reflection to ask ourselves where we lost our way, to correct and advance decidedly.”

Thai lawmakers debate demands for constitutional changes

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s political battleground shifted Tuesday from the streets to the country’s Parliament, where lawmakers are considering proposals to amend the constitution, one of the core demands of the nation’s student-led pro-democracy movement.

Seven draft constitutional amendments are scheduled to be voted on in a two-day joint session of the House and Senate. Constitutional changes require a joint vote of those two bodies. Any that are passed will have to go through second and third readings at least a month after this week’s vote.

Thailand has had 20 constitutions since abolishing the absolute monarchy in 1932 in favor of a constitutional monarchy.



It is not expected that Parliament at this point will agree on specific changes for inclusion in a new charter, though the protesters back a draft that would roll back aspects of the current 2017 constitution — enacted during military rule — that granted extra powers to unelected branches of government.

Instead, Parliament is likely to establish a constitution drafting committee to write a new charter. This would allow the government to say it is willing to meet the protesters’ demands at least halfway, while buying time with a process that could extend over many months.

Consensus could also be reached on a draft that would allow all points in the constitution to be amended, with the significant exception of articles concerning the monarchy. Reform of the monarchy is another key demand of the protest movement, which believes the royal institution is too powerful and lacking accountability.

But any consideration of sections concerning the monarchy is fiercely opposed by the government and its supporters, who consider the institution untouchable. The sole draft that calls for considering amending all parts of the constitution is almost certain to be rejected.

The pro-democracy movement, which supports substantial changes to the constitution, says it plans to have its followers surround the Parliament building in a show of strength. The movement has been staging mass rallies of thousands of people around the country for months.

A contending group of a couple of hundred royalists who oppose changes gathered outside of Parliament on Tuesday morning as the session opened and departed ahead of the expected afternoon arrival of the pro-democracy group.

The Parliamentary session is an effort by the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to take the initiative away from the pro-democracy movement, which in addition to seeking constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy wants Prayuth and his government to step down.

The protesters allege that Prayuth, who as army chief in 2014 led a coup that ousted an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say the constitution, written and enacted under military rule, is undemocratic.

It is their unprecedented demand for reforms to the monarchy that has caused the most stir. The issue touches a raw nerve in Thailand, where reverence for the royal institution is inculcated from birth and protected by a law that makes defaming the monarch and his immediate family punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

The most controversial amendment is the one proposed by a progressive civic association, the Internet Law Reform Dialogue, which collected about 100,000 signatures to put it on the parliamentary agenda. It seeks many specific changes to the 2017 charter, but its biggest sticking point is that it would allow changes to be made in articles in the constitution covering the monarchy.

China positions rocket ahead of ambitious lunar mission

BEIJING (AP) — China on Tuesday moved a massive rocket into place in preparation for launching a mission to bring back materials from the moon for the first time in four decades.

The Long March-5 was transported by tractor from its hangar to the nearby launch site at the space base in Wenchang along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.

The Chang’e 5 mission it will carry is scheduled to launch early next week, placing a lander on the moon that will drill 2 meters (almost 7 feet) beneath the surface and scoop up rocks and other debris to be brought to earth. That would allow scientists to study newly obtained lunar materials for the fist time since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.



The mission, named for the Chinese moon goddess, is among China's most ambitious as its space program continues to build steam since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.

China currently has a mission on the way to Mars, along with a rover on the moon's far side that is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.

China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, although U.S. law still prevents collaboration with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.

The space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The Long March-5, nicknamed “Fat 5” because of its bulky shape, failed on a previous launch attempt, but China’s enormous pool of technical and engineering talent appears to have allowed it to overcome most obstacles.

Pooled COVID-19 testing can help keep kids in school


The goal is to allow schools to remain in operation, which will benefit the social, emotional, and academic development of children as well as create conditions to fully activate the workforce.

Massachusetts finds itself in a second COVID-19 spike. New daily case numbers have ticked above 2,000 for the first time in six months. Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have risen 46 percent since Sept. 23. The mask mandate and limitations on gathering sizes ordered by Governor Baker could soon be followed by rolling back the state’s reopening phases. We are in the early days of what we have been warned will be a long winter of trying to keep this virus in check, plunging us into a renewed and painful discussion about which businesses and job activities are truly essential and how we keep workers and patrons safe.

Related: Mass. reports more than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases for six days straight

Notably, the list of essential activities identified in the spring neglected to include one critical area that should be added to the list: schools.



While Somerville is already in the process of reopening schools, we know that access to testing is a critical component for understanding how and when COVID-19 could spread within a school environment and the community as a whole. Quality testing is among the top priorities for communities throughout the state, and it will take an innovative approach to make it happen.

Related: Working with area’s colleges, Broad Institute surpasses 1 million COVID-19 tests

That’s why we’ve partnered with Tufts University and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard on a pooled testing program. It costs one-third the amount of individual testing and has been proved as an effective means of testing large groups of people where positive test results are expected to be low. Teachers will be tested twice a week and students will be tested once a week. Eight samples will be bundled together and tested by the Broad. If a positive result comes back from a given group, we will then go back and retest all eight subjects from that group. It allows much broader and more regular testing of our students, teachers, and school staff.

Related: Boston to randomly test teachers and other educators weekly for COVID-19

Pooled testing is not new; it is a strategy that has been effective since well before COVID-19 became a reality. It will allow us to conduct universal, free, weekly testing of everyone in our schools as opposed to random sampling, allowing us to catch potential outbreaks before they spiral out of control. What is novel about our approach is using it for students, teachers, and staff in our K-12 schools to help make sure we can provide the necessary in-person education and resources for students and families. On top of testing protocols, we will add robust contact tracing so we can identify those who have had exposure to the disease, creating a full and well-rounded approach to mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

Related: Boston Infectious Disease Specialists: Baker’s COVID-19 guidelines can get Mass. back to work and school

The goal is to allow schools to remain in operation even as other elements of society face potential closures. It will benefit the social, emotional, and academic development of children as well as create conditions to fully activate the workforce, particularly working mothers.

This is a scalable system that can be extended to the state. Securing schools was something communities could not have had in place when this pandemic first hit in March, but we can make a smart investment in it now. This model is designed for persistent large-scale testing, providing essential insights about COVID-19 so schools don’t become vectors for larger community spread. We will test every student and staff member every week.

Regular surveillance testing is a critical element to making sure people aren’t unknowingly walking COVID-19 into schools, or into homes from our schools. According to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, “While schools provide many important benefits, they also are at risk for outbreaks. Recent studies have found that infected children are able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other children and adults.” If community spread spikes out of control, then we may have to close schools or delay reopenings, but this is how we give ourselves the best possible chance of getting kids back in school and keeping them open.

Related: Mass. reports 191 new coronavirus cases among public school students, 157 among school staff members

Local and state leaders must play an active role in securing what we deem to be essential functions. The governor is correct that all of our communities should be working toward in-person schooling. Yet state leadership must put substantial financial support on the table. The good news is that the incoming Biden administration says it wants to fund educational resiliency during the coronavirus pandemic. So the opportunity is ripe to make an investment in universal testing. Every district should have a testing system as comprehensive and ubiquitous as what we’re launching in Somerville. Adopting a similar program at a statewide level presents an opportunity for Massachusetts to prioritize our school-aged children, their families, and every person who works in those schools with a robust and affordable testing system.

Joseph Curtatone is the mayor of Somerville.

What Joe Biden should say about white supremacy


The start of the Biden-Harris administration would be the ideal time to attempt something that has never been done before: Name, confront, and end white supremacy.


By Barbara SmithUpdated November 16, 2020, 4:17 p.m.



Joe Biden was sworn in as vice president during the official swearing-in ceremony at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20, 2013. What will he say when he's inaugurated Jan. 20, 2021?SAUL LOEB





The results of the Nov. 3 election indicate that a small majority of Americans no longer want a white nationalist to run this country. This is a great relief, especially to the millions of people of color who have been the target of some of the worst racial attacks since the Jim Crow era. From profanity-laced diatribes about Black countries, the Muslim ban, and caging children, to the murderous vigilantes Trump has inspired in Pittsburgh, El Paso, and Kenosha his administration has been a spectacle of white supremacy. Voting Trump out of office, however, is only one step in confronting America’s ongoing racial crisis.

There are numerous calls for the nation to unify and heal its divisions, but how can that occur without confronting the racial chasm that has been the most consistent source of conflict since the country began?



Related: Renée Graham: America doesn’t want unity. It wants absolution without restitution

The start of the Biden-Harris administration would be the ideal time to attempt something that has never been done before, which is to name, confront, and end white supremacy.

The following is a speech that President-elect Joe Biden could deliver during the first week of his presidency:

“I ultimately made the decision to run for president because of what occurred in Charlottesville in 2017 and how my predecessor characterized both those who oppose racism and those who promote it as ‘very fine people.’ Like many Americans, I was sickened by the divisive direction in which the country was headed. In the past year, with the horrific killing of George Floyd, many other incidents of racial violence, and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color, I have spoken out against systemic racism and pledged that my administration is committed to challenging it.

Related: Black Americans, suffering disproportionately from COVID-19, face a mounting mental health crisis

“In recent weeks, however, I have become aware that the situation of racial injustice that the nation faces is even more urgent and complex than I had previously believed. I now understand that what we face is not merely racial discrimination or even systemic racism, but institutionalized white supremacy.

“Although seldom acknowledged and purposefully hidden, systemic white supremacy has shaped America’s economy, politics, social relations, and culture from the very beginning. The nation’s origin story embodies it. This land was stolen from Indigenous people through genocide and removal, and its wealth was built by labor stolen from enslaved Africans. Those events have massive repercussions to this day, especially when we look at the high rates of poverty and unemployment in Indigenous, Black, and brown communities.

Related: Barbara Smith: The problem is white supremacy

“I know that some folks may not like the term systemic white supremacy because they see it as an attack on white people. I wondered about that too, but I found out that it does not primarily refer to individual attitudes or behaviors, but to a powerful, entrenched system that consistently disadvantages people of color and privileges whites.

“When we talk about racism, we usually focus on race relations, how different kinds of people do or do not get along. Challenging individual bigotry is critical, but we have a much larger task. We need to look at the impact of systemic white supremacy on all aspects of American life.

“One of the clearest ways to grasp its impact is to examine statistics. On average a Black family headed by a person with an advanced degree has less wealth than a white family headed by a person with a high school diploma. The net worth of white families is nearly 10 times more than that of Black families. Black women’s maternal mortality rate is three times that of white women. Black and Latinx children are more than 2.5 times more likely to live in poverty than white children. Black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men.

Related: Globe Op-Talk: The problem is white supremacy

“These are only a few examples of how discriminatory policies and practices make the words ‘land of opportunity’ sound hollow to far too many hard-working people of color. It is time to stop playing around the edges of this problem and to fix it.

“Here are some of the actions my administration will take in the first one hundred days:

▪ I will appoint a racial justice czar who will oversee all governmental actions to address systemic white supremacy. One of their duties will be to determine the feasibility of launching a comprehensive set of interventions on the scale of the Marshall Plan to eradicate white supremacy. My current proposals for advancing racial equity in the economy, criminal justice, and health care could become core components of this larger initiative.

▪ I will engage in open dialogue with leaders who call for defunding or abolishing the police to better understand their recommendations for transforming our criminal justice system.

▪ We will support the passage of a bill before Congress (H. R. 40), the “Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act.”

▪ We will explore initiating a Truth and Reconciliation process in consultation with countries such as Germany, South Africa, and Rwanda.

▪ We will aggressively investigate and prosecute white supremacist and white nationalist domestic terrorists who currently pose the most significant threats to the nation’s internal security.

▪ We will examine how our foreign policy and military interventions have promoted white supremacist and xenophobic agendas and will develop more just ways to interact with the global community.

“What I have outlined here are only the first steps to righting historic wrongs that have held back this nation for centuries. I will not be able to do any of this without your open-hearted participation and support. It will not be easy, but I believe that when we end racial injustice once and for all, we will become the vibrant, inclusive democracy that America was meant to be.”

This is the kind of speech that I would like Biden to give, but I do not expect that he will. It is possible that his extensive plans for increasing racial equity through economic opportunity could have an impact if fully implemented. I continue to hold onto a larger vision that challenges all of us to look at the reasons we have been stuck in this racial nightmare for more than 400 years and what we finally need to do to change it.

We can take comfort that during this perilous time we have grown tenacious grass-roots movements in opposition to violent policing, economic inequality, white supremacy, and more. As always, it is the people on the ground speaking out and doing the day-to-day work of organizing that will push America closer to freedom.

The courts must protect the 2020 Census


Federal judges should extend the deadline to ensure an accurate count. And the Supreme Court must uphold the centuries-long tradition of counting all residents.


By The Editorial BoardUpdated November 17, 2020, 4:00 a.m.



A full and accurate count of the US population, a tradition dating back to 1790, is currently under threat.Matt Rourke/Associated Press





Every decade, the US government must conduct a full census that counts all the nation’s residents, regardless of their immigration status, according to federal law and a tradition that dates back to 1790. But that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from attempting to exclude whole swaths of the US population from the count. It now falls to the courts to make sure that this year’s constitutionally mandated count is accurate.

The 2020 Census has faced two threats: First, as the pandemic has made it difficult to get an accurate count on the typical timeline, the Trump administration and the Republicans in the US Senate have thwarted attempts to extend the deadline. And second, President Trump is aiming to exclude US residents who are undocumented immigrants from the count he turns over to Congress.



By law, the count is due to be delivered to the president by Dec. 31 of the census year. The president then passes on the count to the House, which determines how the House’s 435 seats will be distributed among the states. The following April, more detailed data go to the states for legislatures to redistrict congressional and legislative boundaries.

Related: Edward J. Markey, Martin J. Walsh, and Iván Espinoza-Madrigal: An accurate census ensures equity

This year, the coronavirus pandemic has posed serious challenges for the Census Bureau in meeting such strict deadlines while fulfilling its duty to fairly and accurately count every resident. That’s why, in April, Trump’s own secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, and Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham sought the assistance of Congress to extend the count through the end of October and delay delivery of the apportionment count until April 30, 2021. They also sought a three-month extension of the deadline for redistricting data sent to the states. It’s not unprecedented. In 1810 and again in 1840, census data was late and Congress approved an extended deadline.

While the House complied with Ross and Dillingham’s request to pass legislation extending the deadlines, majority leader Mitch McConnell’s Senate has so far failed to do the same. Advocates who pushed for an extension of the count were back in US District Court Judge Lucy Koh’s court Nov. 13 asking that she reinstate her order to extend the Dec. 31 deadline to April 30, which Koh did initially before the Department of Justice appealed to the Supreme Court, ending the count in mid-October. The advocates argued that people of color and immigrants, populations that have traditionally been undercounted, would not be adequately counted in 2020. In addition, there are multiple allegations made by census takers that they were pressured by supervisors to enter inaccurate data counts in order to meet the shortened deadline, including workers in Massachusetts. The Associated Press reported Koh said she may set a trial date for early next year.

Related: John Thompson: The 2020 Census, shaping the future of democracy in the United States

Meanwhile, on Nov. 30, the Supreme Court will hear a fast-tracked appeal for the Trump administration’s bid to exclude undocumented residents from the census. Citing the Constitution’s plain language to count every person — as noted on the Census Bureau’s own website — several lower courts have already ruled against this effort. The case comes on the heels of a June Court decision which ruled against Trump’s efforts to have a citizenship question included in the census, a tactic meant to instill fear in undocumented immigrants so they wouldn’t participate in the count.

So why is the census deadline, and the Nov. 30 hearing, important to the fate of every American?

Having an accurate count of all residents ensures equity across the nation. Census data is used to distribute federal dollars to states for Medicaid and education services like Head Start, among nearly 100 other federal programs. That data also helps local and state governments, as well as businesses, plan future projects based on demographics.

Related: David Daley: It’s the PowerPoint that redefined American politics

And, of course, the very reason that the census has a target on its back is that it is essential to majority rule, a central principle of our democracy but one that too many Republicans have calculated will usher in their obsolescence. What they seek to rein in, most likely, by curtailing the count is the reapportionment of seats in the US House of Representatives. More Republican seats in Congress and Republican electoral votes relative to the number of Democratic seats and electoral votes poised to swell with an accurate census translates into more power.

Related: Chris Dunn: The long fight to protect the census from Trump

The Supreme Court should guarantee undocumented residents are recorded in the census count. Further, to ensure integrity in the count, the courts should honor the Census Bureau’s request that the deadline be extended.

Additionally, census bureau officials, Congress, and residents should be alert for further attempts by the Trump administration to thwart the rule of law — and the rules of simple arithmetic.

Pope John Paul II was no saint. Neither is Pope Francis


Putting much of the blame on a dead pope is a convenient outcome for a living one.


By Joan Vennochi Globe Columnist,Updated November 16, 2020, 12:10 p.m.



In this 2015 file photo, Pope Francis reaches out to hug Cardinal Archbishop emeritus Theodore McCarrick after the Midday Prayer of the Divine at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington.Jonathan Newton/Associated Press





Last week’s big headline about Pope Francis concerned the call he made to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden. A 449 page Vatican report, also released last week, presented a less pleasant revelation — that Francis knew of “allegations and rumors” of sexual abuse involving former cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick but didn’t pursue them because he believed others before him had properly vetted the matter.

Related: Vatican faults many for McCarrick’s rise but spares pope

The report holds Pope John Paul II — who died in 2005 — mostly accountable for McCarrick’s elevation to the top of the church hierarchy, despite decades of explicit warnings about sexual abuse. Francis — who canonized John Paul in 2014 and also launched the Vatican investigation into the McCarrick matter, in 2018 — is essentially let off the hook. In the wake of the findings, the sainthood of John Paul II is being questioned, while Francis is vowing to “eradicate” sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.



Putting much of the blame on a dead pope is a convenient outcome for a living one. But what about Francis’s role? Protecting him from shared responsibility, the report draws a line between gossip that he might have heard and confirmed knowledge. Yet the details suggest that he, too, was part of a deliberate blindness that allowed predators like McCarrick to flourish. As Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability, a group that gathers information on clergy abuse, told The Washington Post that Francis’s “lack of curiosity” about the allegations against McCarrick “was at best negligent, at worst corrupt.”

Related: 2002 Globe Spotlight: Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church

The Vatican report provides graphic institutional documentation of the longstanding pattern of church leaders, first exposed by the media, to believe and protect the powerful over the powerless.

McCarrick was ordained in 1958, and according to a timeline compiled by Catholic Review, the first child he baptized later alleged he was abused by the new priest. Allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct followed McCarrick throughout his career. Despite that, he was appointed archbishop of Washington in 2000 by John Paul and elevated to cardinal in 2001. At the time, he was already known to have shared a bed with “young adult men,” the report said, as well as with adult seminarians. A New Jersey mother had also sent letters to church leaders that related incidents of McCarrick’s inappropriate touching of her sons. However, according to the report, McCarrick swore on his “oath as a bishop” the allegations were false and John Paul chose to believe him.

New allegations surfaced during the tenure of Pope Benedict VI, leading to McCarrick’s resignation in 2006 as archbishop of Washington. However, he still traveled the world as a church diplomat, and was known as a political mover and shaker, as well as a prolific fund-raiser. Yet, according to the report, his fund-raising skills were “not determinative” of decisions made about his career.

Francis became pope in 2013, and according to the report, up to that point, “had never heard rumors related to McCarrick’s past conduct.” After that, he acknowledged hearing “old allegations” that had been “gossiped about.” But until 2017, no one “provided Pope Francis with any documentation regarding allegations against McCarrick‚” the report said. Prior to that, “Pope Francis had heard only that there had been allegations and rumors related to immoral conduct with adults occurring prior to McCarrick’s appointment to Washington.” The report said Francis believed his predecessors had properly vetted the issue so there was no need for any further investigation. In June 2017, Francis learned of “the first known allegation of sexual abuse by McCarrick of a victim under 18.” In July 2018, Francis accepted McCarrick’s resignation from the College of Cardinals.

Related: In a moment of turmoil, US Catholic bishops meet virtually

The story is not yet over, as much as the church wants it to be. It took until 2019 for Francis to defrock McCarrick, and while Francis is now expressing his “closeness to the victims of all abuse,” a Vatican action plan for addressing wrongdoing by bishops is still pending.

In priests like McCarrick, with access to power and money, the church found glory; in victims, the church found reasons to disbelieve or disregard. When analyzed by those strictly secular terms, John Paul is no saint — and neither is Francis.

Meanwhile, his call to Biden is in keeping with the church’s centuries-old tradition: Decide where the power lies and embrace it.

Former Harvard fencing coach, Maryland businessman charged in $1.5m college admissions bribery scheme





By Dugan Arnett, Travis Andersen and Evan Allen Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 10:51 a.m.

Harvard’s former fencing coach and a Maryland telecommunications executive were arrested by federal authorities Monday in an elaborate $1.5 million bribery scheme that allegedly secured the businessman’s sons entry into the school and spots on the vaunted fencing team.

Jie “Jack” Zhao, 61, of Potomac, Md., bought legendary fencing coach Peter Brand’s Needham house at an inflated price, renovated Brand’s new condo, paid his car loan and utility bills, and funneled other payments to Brand through nonprofit foundations, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in federal court in Boston.



In exchange, prosecutors said, Brand, 67, of Cambridge, promised spots on the school’s fencing team, and recruited both of Zhao’s sons, one of which entered Harvard in 2014, the other in 2017.

The federal charges marked the first time Harvard staff has been criminally implicated in the admissions scandal roiling campuses across the country. The alleged Harvard scam played out over several years, involving several men at the top of the rarefied sport, reaching into international fencing tournaments and a well-known training academy, while corrupting Harvard’s process for recruiting elite athletes.

Related: He bought the fencing coach’s house. Then his son got into Harvard

“This case is part of our long-standing effort to expose and deter corruption in college admissions,” US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement. “Millions of teenagers strive for college admission every year. We will do our part to make that playing field as level as we possibly can.”

The federal charges follow a series of Boston Globe investigative reports that began last year, the first of which raised questions about Zhao’s purchase of Brand’s home at an inflated price, around the time of his younger son’s recruitment. Later, Globe stories revealed other financial transactions and text messages that allegedly outlined the recruitment scheme.

Following the reports, Harvard opened an investigation and ultimately fired Brand; the US attorney’s office for Massachusetts convened a federal grand jury.

The stories rocked the fencing community and dragged Harvard, for the first time, into an ongoing national college admissions scandal. But while Operation Varsity Blues involved resume-padding and inflated test scores, prosecutors portrayed the fencing recruitment scam as a more direct bribery scheme.

In an e-mail, Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane declined to comment.

Both men appeared in court Monday afternoon, Brand in Boston and Zhao in Maryland. A bearded Brand said little during the afternoon video proceeding and was later released on bond.

His attorney, Douglas Brooks, said in an e-mail that “Coach Brand did nothing wrong in connection with [the sons’] admission to Harvard. He looks forward to the truth coming out in court.”

An attorney for Zhao, multimillionaire cofounder of the global telecommunications company iTalk Global Communications Inc., said via e-mail that his client denies the charges. William D. Weinreb said Zhao’s sons were “academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit."

The scheme, according to prosecutors, stems from Brand’s desire for personal financial support, and Zhao’s yearning to have his sons attend Harvard.

The earliest seeds of the plot originated in 2012, when Brand came into the orbit of Zhao, whose older son at the time was a high school sophomore and an “accomplished fencer,” according to the federal complaint. The son trained at a fencing academy run by a man identified in court papers as “co-conspirator one,” who lives in Virginia and is now cooperating with authorities.

Though he wasn’t named in the court filings, the Globe has identified him as Alexandre Ryjik, the Soviet-trained head of the Virginia Academy of Fencing, where both of Zhao’s sons trained, and the president of the National Fencing Foundation, a nonprofit “dedicated to developing the personal character, academic achievement and athletic excellence through the world of fencing.”

An attorney for Ryjik, whose fencing academy has closed due to COVID-19, did not respond to an e-mail or phone call seeking comment. Phil Sbarbaro, an attorney on Ryjik’s foundation board, hung up on a reporter and did not respond to a subsequent e-mail. An inquiry to the foundation’s main mailbox went unanswered.

Prosecutors said the alleged co-conspirator told them that Zhao wanted his older son to attend Harvard.

Around that time, prosecutors allege, Brand and his wife, who worked for the city of Cambridge, had been having financial troubles and could “barely pay the bills,” according to an e-mail she sent him from her work account in February 2009.

Initially, Brand was allegedly noncommittal about recruiting him Zhao’s older son.

However, Brand texted Ryjik in May 2012 that Zhao’s sons “don’t have to be great fencers,” and that Brand just needed “a good incentive” to recruit the boys, according to messages reviewed by the Globe and later cited in the federal complaint. That text came less than two weeks after Brand’s wife had warned that the couple had “maxed out” their equity line of credit, the complaint said.

From there, the men allegedly hatched a plot that involved Zhao making a donation to Ryjik’s fencing charity, which would then make a donation to a nonprofit Brand was planning to start, prosecutors say. In February 2013, Zhao paid about $1 million to the National Fencing Foundation, the largest single payout the charity had ever received, by far.

Meanwhile, Brand and his wife started the Peter Brand Foundation.

Ultimately, prosecutors said, $100,000 was transferred from the fencing foundation to the Brand Foundation, and Zhao later began making direct payments to Brand.

Those payments allegedly included more than $8,000 toward Brand’s son’s college tuition; about $32,000 to pay the son’s educational loans; just over $119,000 toward the mortgage on Brand’s then-Needham home; about $2,500 for Brand’s water and sewer bill; and roughly $34,000 for a car loan, the complaint said.

Brand later helped facilitate the admission of Zhao’s younger son in the summer of 2016, according to prosecutors. Around the same time, Zhao agreed to buy Brand’s home for $989,500, more than $440,000 over the property’s assessed value.

The Needham assessor wrote in his notes that the sale of the Needham property made “NO SENSE.” Brand, for his part, subsequently purchased a $1.3 million apartment in Cambridge, offering $311,000 over asking price in what the realtor who represented the sellers later told the Globe was “a very aggressive offer.”

Zhao in July 2017 listed the Needham residence for $699,000, about $300,000 less than he bought it for. The home sold for $665,000.

In July 2019, following Globe reports, Harvard fired Brand. The school said an “independent investigation of the matter is now complete, and Mr. Brand has been dismissed from his position for violating Harvard’s conflict-of-interest policy.

The firing capped a sharp fall from the grace for the coach, who had arrived at the university in 1999 and propelled its beleaguered team from the bottom of the Ivy League rankings to the top, sending fencers to the Olympics and earning a cascade of “coach of the year” accolades. He regularly traveled to international tournaments, and had a strong reputation in the tight-knit fencing community.

But on Monday, he was released from federal custody on $500,000 bond, ordered to surrender any passports and avoid contact with Zhao, his alleged benefactor.

Across the region, officials and passengers seek to put brakes on MBTA service cuts





By Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 7:04 p.m.

The MBTA’s proposed budget cuts have sparked an outcry from passengers and political leaders who say scaling back public transit will have both immediate and longer-term ramifications, hindering frontline workers while undercutting the region’s post-pandemic economic gains.

“I think the big problem is that these cuts are going to hurt the recovery as we think about moving forward," said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “And right now, these cuts are going to hurt the essential and frontline workers.” The two issues, he said, are of “equal” concern.

Walsh is part of a chorus of opposition to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s cash-saving plan that has emerged in recent days. Transit officials say the cutbacks are necessary to balance a budget thrown into deficit by collapsing revenue and are designed to minimize disruptions to riders on the busiest parts of the system.



But critics have said the cuts are shortsighted. At a rally near Mission Hill last week, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley decried the federal and state governments for “failing” T riders, while Hull town manager Philip Lemnios has called on the agency to raise fares rather than eliminate ferry service.

“I think they ought to be doing everything they can to make sure people can move in and around the Boston area, because that’s their primary function,” Lemnios said.

The MBTA’s proposal, unveiled last week, would reduce bus and train frequencies across most of the system, while ending service on the commuter rail after 9 p.m., eliminating weekend commuter rail trips, shuttering the ferry system, and shortening certain routes. The cuts would take effect next year, mostly between spring and summer.

The MBTA stressed that the plan is not final and noted that the agency is holding more than a dozen hearings about the reductions before its oversight board votes on the plan in December.

“The MBTA is carrying out a comprehensive outreach process as it wants public feedback and will take it seriously,” general manager Steve Poftak said in a statement.

Under the proposal, officials expect to save about $128 million next fiscal year, marking one of several measures to plug a budget gap that could exceed $575 million as the agency reels from a massive decline in fare revenue during the pandemic.

Transit agencies and advocates have called on Congress to help stave off cuts, but negotiations on a coronavirus relief bill have stalled.

Walsh suggested Massachusetts lawmakers dip into the state’s rainy day fund to avoid some cuts. The House of Representatives last week passed a budget plan for the ongoing fiscal year that did not increase MBTA funding in order to close its deficit. The Senate budget up for debate this week does not either, though a proposed amendment would increase MBTA funding by about $300 million.

Although MBTA officials have described the cuts as a “last resort,” they have also said they may move forward with many of the changes even if a federal or state funding package is approved. The cuts are justified in part by the low number of riders using most of the system, they said.

But those riders depend on the system and may struggle to get around if service is cut, said Brockton Mayor Robert Sullivan.

“Some work late shifts or early morning shifts,” Sullivan said. The city’s commuter rail stations "are not being as used as much during the pandemic, I recognize that, but there are going to be many workers who can’t find reliable transit to get into their jobs.”

Willie Faye Clay, 63, lives near the Heath Street Green Line stop at the border of Jamaica Plain and Mission Hill. The MBTA’s plan to end the Green Line five stops earlier at Brigham Circle, saving $2 million, will make it more difficult to run errands, she said.

“It’s not that many stops from Brigham Circle to Heath Street,” said Clay, who uses a wheelchair and says it’s harder to take the bus. “I think they should consider the impact of how it would affect people.”

Meanwhile, the timing of the cuts could backfire if a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available and commuters begin returning to work in the spring or summer.

While work and travel habits may well be different in the pandemic’s aftermath, the end of the public health crisis would undoubtedly increase daily trips into and around Boston. Reduced transit service could also exacerbate Boston traffic, further hampering the economy and creating more fuel emissions.

“I’m already looking into it, because the writing is on the wall, but I’m looking into buying a car and paying for parking,” said Brenda Connors, who lives in Hull and has taken the ferry to her job as a dental assistant in Boston throughout the pandemic.

MBTA officials have said the eliminated services can resume as ridership and fare revenue rebound, but the agency’s own presentation materials say it could take up to two years to hire and train drivers to operate the restored trips. And officials have so far struggled to clearly explain how they’ll know it’s time to bring back closed services except by monitoring ridership on other parts of the system and public feedback over time.

“I wish there was an easier answer, so that we can say ‘if you do A, B, and C, we will be in a position where we will be bringing that particular route back,'" MBTA deputy general manager Jeff Gonneville said at a virtual public meeting last week, responding to a question from a rider. “Admittedly, this is something we are hearing a fair amount."

The last stand-up guy


Howie Winter was a gangster. He killed people. But he wasn’t a rat, and in his world that meant something


By Kevin Cullen Globe Columnist,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:08 p.m.



State Troopers led Howie Winter into the Medford State Police Barracks in 2012.Josh Reynolds





Howie Winter wasn’t a bad guy, once you got past the murders.

Howie ran around Somerville long before it became hip. He became a Marine, one of the most honorable things you could do where he came from.

And then he became a gangster, which wasn’t necessarily the most dishonorable thing you could do where he came from.



Howie was Tom Brady to Buddy McLean’s Drew Bledsoe. Buddy McLean ran the Winter Hill Gang, named for the section of Somerville where they congregated. Buddy got whacked, in a hit that just about ended the Irish gang wars of the 1960s, which were enabled by an FBI determined to play kingmaker. Howie took over, and took Winter Hill to new heights.

Everybody played the number, and the number was run by the Mafia and the Winter Hill Gang. There was so much money to be made that the Italians who ran the Mafia in the North End and the mostly Irish guys in Winter Hill had an alliance.

In 1972, Howie no doubt saved lives when, during a sit-down at Chandler’s, a mob hangout in the South End, he mediated an end to the war between the Killeens, who ran the rackets in the Lower End of South Boston, and the Mullens, a bunch of upstarts from City Point.

Howie convinced the combatants to end their murderous feud and join forces. Surprisingly, he anointed Whitey Bulger, the Southie mobster, to lead the new faction, rather than one of the Mullens. Several of the Mullens, most notably a capable guy named Pat Nee, were Marines.

But as Howie explained to me and my colleague Shelley Murphy, Whitey had a better criminal pedigree: He went to Alcatraz. In a different milieu, that would be like saying a prospective employee went to Harvard Business School.

Howie came to rue the day he backed Whitey Bulger and sponsored him as a full-fledged partner in the Winter Hill Gang. Bulger and another partner, Stevie Flemmi, were FBI informants. Howie should have figured that out in 1979, when he and everybody in the gang, except Bulger and Flemmi, were indicted for fixing horse races.

Just about all of Howie’s closest associates became government informants or witnesses. In a 1989 interview, Howie complained to me that law enforcement wouldn’t leave him alone, even after he got out of prison and tried to stay crime-free.

“When I was a kid, when I heard about Nazi Germany, how they wanted everyone to turn people in . . . and that’s what’s going on here now," he said. "If you’re a man, you get punished. If you’re a rat and a weasel, you’re rewarded, you’re cultivated.”

In 1993, facing 10 years in prison for arranging the delivery of 13 pounds of cocaine to a friend who turned out to be working for the government, Howie refused a chance to cut a deal and roll on Bulger and Flemmi. He stood up and did his time.





Even John Martorano, among his closest criminal partners, testified during Bulger’s trial that he and Winter took part in numerous murders. Howie was never charged, however, because as part of his plea deal Martorano refused to testify directly against Howie and prosecutors couldn’t find anyone else to corroborate Martorano’s account.

After the trial, during a lunch at the Union Oyster House put together by the great private investigator Ted McDonough, I asked Howie about all those murders he was implicated in.

Without copping to anything, Howie suggested it isn’t murder when someone is trying to kill you.

“That’s self-defense,” Howie said.

But that doesn’t explain what happened in 1973 to Michael Milano, a young bartender who died in a hail of gunfire when, Martorano testified, he and Winter opened fire on his car, mistaking him for a gangster that Mafia underboss Jerry Angiulo had ordered dead. A passenger in the car was paralyzed.

Howie died in his own bed last week. He was 91, a guy who was hard not to like. But he was a gangster, and he killed people. None of those facts stand alone. They stand together.

Jury trials resume with masks, plexiglass barriers, and reconfigured courtrooms





By Shelley Murphy Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 8:03 p.m.



Massachusetts’ state courts will resume jury trials at the end of the month for the first time since the pandemic began, with plexiglass barriers and reconfigured courtrooms among a host of new safety protections as coronavirus infections surge across the state.

With the judicial system facing a growing backlog, the initial trials will serve as a test for a broader reopening, with six-member juries presiding over short, fairly simple criminal and civil cases at nine courthouses. If things go smoothly, then full, 12-member juries will be impaneled in February to hear high-priority cases, particularly those involving inmates awaiting trial on serious criminal charges.



“This is a very challenging undertaking and we are working very hard at it,” said Superior Court Chief Justice Judith Fabricant, a member of an advisory committee that in July issued a detailed report on how to safely resume trials. “We are determined to provide due process to the parties in the cases that are pending, while balancing risks to jurors, trial participants and court staff.”

Court officials, prosecutors, and defense lawyers worry about trials being indefinitely delayed, depriving defendants of their right to a speedy trial. But a return to trials has raised a host of safety concerns.

“We’re in uncharted territory here,” said Attorney Randy Gioia, deputy chief counsel of the public defender division of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, a state agency that provides lawyers for indigent defendants. “There’s no easy solution to this, so you’ve got to be careful that people’s very important constitutional rights are upheld, even in this stressful, unique time.”

A key question is how many people will show up for jury duty, given the health risks. By state law, any juror may defer service for a year, while those over 70 may decline to serve. Jurors may also ask to be excused for health reasons or issues related to the coronavirus, such as an underlying condition, fear of exposing a vulnerable household member to the virus, or child-care issues.

Gioia said his primary concern is whether jurors who are able to serve will represent a fair cross-section of the community. He noted that infection rates are high in many racially diverse communities, which could result in fewer potential jurors from those areas.

“You need people from the communities where the people who are facing a loss of freedom are from. That to me is what a jury of your peers is, people who have similar life experiences,” Gioia said. “I’m fearful that we’re not going to have that if we can’t convince people that the courthouses are very safe."

Fabricant said court officials share that concern and will be monitoring the selection process to make sure that juries are diverse.

Jurors will be required to assess their health every day and notify the court if they have any COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to anyone with the coronavirus. Everyone in the courtroom will wear a mask at all times, except for witnesses who may remove them once they are on the stand, which is shielded by plexiglass.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said she had concerns about whether the courts will be able to complete jury trials given the alarming rise in coronavirus cases and the approaching holidays.

“I think everyone would agree that all sides are entitled to have jurors that really can put their full attention on the evidence they’re hearing,” Ryan said. “And it’s hard to expect people to do that if they are worried about their own safety.”

Derege Demissie, a Cambridge defense lawyer, said the pandemic restrictions will impact his ability to represent his client. He will not be able to sit beside his client as he has always done, sharing their concerns as evidence is presented. Typically, Demissie said he watches jurors as they listen to a case unfold, relying on their expressions to let him know when he’s pushing a witness too hard or should delve deeper. But with jurors wearing masks, that becomes impossible.

“You can’t have a jury trial that doesn’t measure up just because you want to get it done,” Demissie said. “If you’re going to do it, you have to do in a way that doesn’t compromise their rights.”

Demissie predicted the new system will move too slowly to make much of a dent in the backlog of trials. He said a better solution would be to release defendants on home confinement with electronic monitoring, resolve more cases with plea bargains, and hold more bench trials without juries.

In the federal courts, just five trials have been held in Massachusetts since they resumed in October with a multitude of safety protocols based on advice from epidemiologists.

Jurors no longer all fit in the jury box because of social distancing guidelines. Evidence cannot be passed to the jury; instead, it’s all viewed on screens. There are no sidebars, with lawyers whispering in a huddle before the judge. Now, they consult on wireless headsets, like football coaches. Even attorneys must sit six feet from their clients.

Rob Farrell, clerk of the US District Court for Massachusetts, said there are more than 60 criminal cases ready for trial and court officials have created a list that prioritizes which should go first. The court is currently focusing on single defendant cases because of social distancing guidelines, and officials are searching for alternate sites that would allow them to hold trials for multiple defendants.

US Attorney Andrew Lelling said it was frustrating to see the system move so slowly, but that judges have done a good job creating protocols to keep everyone safe.

“Judges are trying to strike a balance between safety and moving the docket,” he said. “I think the approach they’ve taken so far is pretty sensible.”

He said they’ve had little difficulty finding jurors, which he attributed to “pandemic fatigue.”

When the court impaneled its first grand jury in May, some people didn’t want to serve because they were fearful of the virus, he recalled. But others jumped at the opportunity.

“We also had grand jurors who said to us, ‘Thank God, I need to get out of the house,’” he said.

They got ‘clobbered’ on Election Day. Now Massachusetts Republicans are weighing whether to change leaders





By Matt Stout Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:18 p.m.

After seeing their small minority on Beacon Hill shrink further this year, Massachusetts Republicans are now pivoting to a fight for control of their deeply divided state party ahead of the 2022 election cycle, when the governor’s office and every legislative seat will be on the ballot.

The election of a new party chair — slated for January — is expected to prove pivotal in determining the direction of the party after years of realizing few electoral gains among candidates not named Charlie Baker.

Jim Lyons, a President Trump ally and former state lawmaker who has led the party since 2019, has said he will seek reelection, and state Representative Shawn Dooley, a House member since 2014, said Monday he will also run for the post, pitching the need for a party “rebranding.”



The $75,000-a-year position is picked by the Massachusetts GOP’s 80-seat state committee, which has increasingly taken on a more conservative bent despite Baker’s efforts to shape it.

More candidates are also eyeing a race that is likely to show the sharp fault lines running through the party, which has hewed closely to President Trump, both in tone and approach, under Lyons.

That conservative rhetoric has often come at the expense of Baker, the state’s popular, moderate governor, and could complicate Baker’s own potential reelection bid in two years even with Trump out of the White House. (Baker has said he is considering vying for an unprecedented third consecutive term.)

“President Trump has brought tremendous energy,” said Lyons, though he acknowledged it’s unclear if it will translate past Trump’s departure on Jan. 20. “My focus since the day I ran in 2019 has been to try to increase our ranks in the Legislature. I really feel a strong desire to see if we can fundamentally change the Republican Party.”

At the ballot box, it’s proven to be a struggle.

There will be just three Republicans in the state Senate come January after the GOP lost five seats in the Legislature during 2020, strengthening Democrats' super-majority in both branches. And while some Republicans felt the results could have been worse, the losses still stung, including in a House district that had been held by Republicans — first by Kevin Poirier, then his wife, Betty Poirier — since the late 1970s.

Further fueling Republican frustration is that the party, on a national level and elsewhere, far exceeded expectations even as it lost the White House.

“There’s no silver lining to any of this,” said Tom Mountain, the state party’s vice chairman. Mountain did not directly address Monday whether he’s considering running for chairman. “We got clobbered. We’re the state [party] that probably got hit the hardest.”

It’s renewed calls from many in the party to embrace a message of unity. Dooley, a former Norfolk town clerk running for the first time to be party chairman, said that in repeatedly attacking Democrats and Baker, the party apparatus has focused too heavily on national issues and ignored the GOP’s “essential” messaging of promoting smaller government, individual liberty, and providing a check on Democrats.

“We need to rebuild our brand,” said Dooley, who also serves on the state committee. “We can’t be attacking Republicans, whether it’s Charlie Baker or the 18-year-old kid who just joined the party. We need to have a unified team working toward the common goal of bringing more balance to the state.”

Dooley said he intends to keep his state representative seat if elected chairman while ceding the “nitty gritty” operations to an executive director and finance director — two positions that Lyons has not filled.

The MassGOP had $80,000 in its federal account as of mid-October and was on pace for its worst fund-raising cycle in 12 years after a lucrative fund-raising operation, built under Baker, collapsed last year. Mountain, the vice chairman, said the party has enough money to cover expenses, including rent, for a few months, but said it’s in “danger of becoming insolvent” without a fund-raising push.

“It’s quite clear that the MassGOP needs a resurrection,” said Susan Smiley, a state committee member and Lancaster Republican who unsuccessfully ran for an open House seat this year. Smiley voted for Lyons in 2019 when he beat a Baker-favored candidate, 47-30, but said the party needs new leadership.

“I think the strategy, if there was a strategy, failed,” she said.

Michael Valanzola, a state committee member and one-time Baker administration official who resigned in 2016, said he is also considering running. Similar to Dooley, he said rebuilding the party’s shrinking GOP caucuses in the State House is critical.

“Jim’s a great guy . . . and I had a lot to do with helping him win two years ago. But we have not necessarily been able to tap into the energy that you’re seeing in other parts of the country,” he said. “People are frustrated by that.”

An adviser to Baker said the governor is not engaged in the race for chair, nor is he supporting a candidate at this point. But Baker stressed at a press conference last week that Massachusetts Republicans need to recalibrate their pitch to voters.

“It’s important for people who run for statewide office to understand that what voters care about here are statewide or local issues. That’s really where our focus as a party needs to be,” Baker said. He did not say, however, whether he’ll be on the ticket in 2022. “That’s a long time away.”

Boston police OT hours slashed by 14 percent, but deeper cuts are still needed to hit budget target





By Danny McDonald Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:06 p.m.



The City Council over the summer passed an operating budget that took a $12 million bite out of the Boston Police Department’s overtime budget amid calls for significant reform.Jessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff





Boston police reduced July through late September overtime hours by 14.6 percent over the same period last year, but deeper cuts are needed if the department is to meet the reduced overtime levels called for in the annual city budget, officials said Monday.

“We’re not on track to hit that right now,” said Councilor Kenzie Bok during a virtual meeting of the City Council’s ways and means committee, which Bok chairs.

The council over the summer passed an operating budget that took a $12 million bite out of the Boston Police Department’s overtime budget amid calls for significant reform. At the time, Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the budget, which included the reallocation of police overtime funding, “makes significant investments in new community-led programs, and that takes bold steps toward our pledge of creating a more just and equitable society.”



In the aftermath of the budget vote, councilors said they want to see structural changes to make the overtime reduction a reality, since police overtime is one of the few line items in the operating budget that is allowed to exceed its allotment, as it did for the last fiscal year, which ended in June.

That means the department actually needs to save $24.5 million compared to what it doled out last year to meet the budgeted level of $48 million in police overtime costs this year. Bok said a 14.6 percent reduction in overtime costs would mean the department would be on track for $10.5 million in savings, well below the $24.5 million figure.

“The commitment in the last budget cycle to realize a percentage of savings, based on what I’m hearing today, doesn’t look like we’re actually going to actualize that commitment,” said Councilor Andrea Campbell. “Which I think is concerning.”

Councilor Matt O’Malley said it was made abundantly clear through the budget process that the city needed to get overtime costs under control.

“For that to actually become a reality, we need to stay on top of it,” said O’Malley.

Boston police Superintendent James Hasson said the department is committed to officer and public safety and indicated that the department had a “pretty comprehensive plan” to reduce overtime, but that because of an increase in crime, demonstrations, feared unrest tied to the presidential election, and the COVID-19 pandemic, “we’ve been unable to implement that.”

“The residents of Boston, they depend on us," he said. "When they call 9-1-1, they have an expectation we’re going to be coming.”

Earlier this year, department officials told city councilors that, on average, 94 positions are back-filled each day to replace officers who are out and still meet mandatory minimum staffing levels, which is a major factor that drives overtime costs.

Replacement costs topped $25 million last year, and more than two-thirds of that involved officers who were filling in for others who were injured, sick, or on vacation, according to authorities. Such costs remain “relatively flat,” compared to last year, accounting for almost 44 percent of total overtime costs, according to reports from Boston police given to the City Council before Monday’s meeting.

According to department reports given to councilors, Boston police have continued “to face the challenge in which our turnover of injured officers has been as frequent of those returning to work due to the increase in demand for full staffing levels and extended hours, coupled with the impact of COVID-19.”

For this fiscal year, the department is projecting 156 retirements from the force. A new class of 110 recruits will start at the end of the month, with the expectation the class will yield 100 new police officers. Another class of 60 recruits is planned next spring, and 50 new officers are expected to emerge from that class.

Monday’s discussion followed months of intense council debate regarding Boston police overtime. The subject was at the heart of a contentious operating budget vote earlier in the summer. Walsh, in a resubmitted budget proposal that came amid widespread demonstrations protesting police brutality, called for reallocating $12 million from Boston police overtime spending to social services and community programs.

For some councilors, however, the rerouting of the $12 million in overtime spending did not do enough work toward dismantling structural racism. In a contentious vote, the council passed the $3.61 billion operating budget, 8-5.

Providence police oversight board PERA faces a firestorm -- from within


Executive Director Jose Batista may have undermined PERA’s mission by releasing videos that could jeopardize the criminal investigation of a police officer


By Amanda Milkovits Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:00 a.m.

PROVIDENCE — The Providence External Review Authority, or PERA, was created after an off-duty Black police officer was killed by two white police officers 20 years ago, overcoming court challenges and upheaval in its fight to establish civilian oversight of the Providence police.

But now, as urgent calls for racial justice and police reform ring through Rhode Island and around the country, the state’s only civilian review authority is struggling internally with a leader whose actions may have jeopardized its mission.

In an emergency meeting Monday night, PERA board members voted 6 to 3 to remove its executive director, Jose Batista, who defied the board, the police, and the attorney general’s office last week to release video footage from a pending criminal case against an officer.



The bystander and police body camera videos show Sergeant Joseph Hanley grinding his knee into a handcuffed man’s head on the pavement, kicking him, and stepping onto his legs during an arrest on April 19. Misdemeanor charges were dropped against the man, who reached a $50,000 settlement with the city. Hanley was charged with simple assault in May.

The board voted against releasing the video in August, to avoid jeopardizing the criminal case against Hanley. But Batista offered the footage to the media last week anyway, saying he wants “transparency” and for PERA to be “at the table” during criminal investigations of police officers.

Civilian review boards do not have authority in criminal investigations, according to Liana Perez, the director of operations for the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, and involving PERA in that capacity would be highly unusual. The Providence city ordinance gives PERA oversight in internal investigations, not criminal ones.

“Usually, you don’t compromise a criminal investigation during an administrative investigation. You shouldn’t cross the line,” Perez said.

The Providence External Review Authority is the only civilian oversight board in Rhode Island. It was proposed after the death of Sergeant Cornel Young Jr., a Black officer who was off-duty when he was fatally shot by two white officers in January 2000, and established by the City Council in 2002.

It is responsible for community outreach, reviewing police policies and training procedures, and making recommendations for reallocation of funds. It is empowered by the mayor and City Council to investigate complaints of police misconduct and, when necessary, make recommendations to the police chief for disciplinary action — a faster and less-intimidating way to resolve complaints than having the public deal with the Police Department’s Internal Affairs division.

The state Supreme Court upheld PERA’s authority in 2008, but the group was inactive until 2018, when the city brought together a new nine-member board, which hired Batista as executive director.

Board member Deborah Wray, a longtime community activist in Providence, said there was hope that the civilian review authority would finally find its footing.

This, Wray said, was supposed to be PERA’s “fresh start.” Now, there’s concern that Batista’s actions threaten PERA’s mission of conducting fair and impartial oversight of the police.

Batista, 32, had previously worked as a public defender and a prosecutor for the city of Pawtucket. A graduate of Roger Williams University School of Law, he was just elected to represent District 12 in the state House of Representatives, and, has also been on the board of College Visions, the city Board of Licenses, and the city’s Ethics Commission. He was given a two-year contract in early 2019, provided that he didn’t continue his law practice or outside employment, to avoid conflicts of interest.

Wray, who was on the hiring committee, said Batista started out well, “but what he said he was capable and knowledgeable of doing, that is not what he has done,” Wray said.

Batista was expected to work on public outreach and review, investigate, and mediate complaints. Instead, he quickly stopped attending Providence police command staff meetings, and meetings with the Providence police union “never got off the ground,” Patrolman Michael Imond, president of the union, said. City records show he brought in outside contractors to do the investigative work, over the objections of the board. According to PERA’s latest biannual report in June, a dozen cases are still waiting for investigation, some well over a year, and another five are waiting for mediation.

“We were asking Batista to be accountable. He was saying he was working on it, but we don’t have information saying what they actually did,” Wray said. The only case they heard about, she said, was the one involving Hanley.

Earlier this year Batista suggested to Attorney General Peter Neronha that he drop charges against Hanley in order to make the videos public. Once the videos had sparked a “public conversation,” Batista said, he proposed that the sergeant be re-charged for the April assault.

Several PERA members were aghast. They wanted the attorney general to increase the charges against the sergeant, not drop them.

“How would it help the general public to see any sort of violence . . . against any sort of citizen and then not hold the officer accountable by releasing that video?” board member Michael Fontaine, a Providence insurance defense lawyer and former state prosecutor, said at a PERA meeting in September. “That was the whole point of this board . . . to have a second set of eyes to ensure officers are held accountable,”

“I’ve been a prosecutor for years, and I’m not aware of them bringing charges, dropping them, and bringing them back, especially after release of evidence. Ever,” Fontaine added.

Batista told the board — and, later, The Boston Globe — that the proposal was hypothetical.

Wray said she doesn’t believe him. “I think Jose lied,” she said. “He thought he was going to have board members to back him no matter what he’d do. He forgot what our mission is,” she said.

After a moped rider, Jhamal Gonsalves, was critically injured in a crash involving a police officer in October, Batista urged the board to authorize $50,000 for a contractor to investigate the case and pushed for PERA to be directly involved with the criminal investigation, along with the state police, Providence police, attorney general’s office, and the federal Department of Justice.

“This is the moment in time that PERA was created for,” Batista told them. Most of the board members balked, saying they still needed standards and accounting for the work being done.

The Police Department also refused Batista’s demands. “If PERA or PERA’s investigator were embedded in the investigation, it would have an adverse impact on the criminal investigation and the criminal prosecution in many ways,” Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Paré wrote to Batista on Oct. 28. “The integrity of the criminal investigation is our primary goal.”

Paré offered PERA daily briefings and said the department would comply with PERA’s requests when it became an internal investigation. A pretrial motion and hearing are scheduled for Nov. 24, and the commissioner said the police were going to release the videos when the case was adjudicated.

Batista told the Globe that wasn’t good enough. He decided to release the Hanley videos on his own to make a point, he told the Globe, and said it’s “a misrepresentation to say I can’t be trusted with sensitive information.”

“The Hanley case was such a high profile case, and we got involved after the fact,” Batista said. “If we want to do our job of civilian oversight, we need to have no daylight between what the police know and what we know.”

But his actions may prevent PERA from doing its work.

“I want to say I hope it doesn’t stop the police from cooperating the way they are supposed to,” Wray said. “I hope and pray that Commissioner Paré, the captains and majors, will take this and understand this is (Batista’s) feelings coming out — and not the board.”

Marine charged with murder, other counts in connection with beating death of Emerson student





By Travis Andersen Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:03 p.m.

The US Marine Corps has charged a reservist lance corporal with murder and other counts in connection with the beating death last year of Emerson College student Daniel Hollis in Allston, the military confirmed Monday.

In a brief statement, the Marines confirmed the charges against Lance Corporal Samuel B. London. He faces charges including murder, manslaughter, assault and battery, and wrongful use of a controlled substance.

The statement added that the charges are “pending adjudication at a General Courts-Martial.”



The statement said charges are “merely an accusation and the accused is innocent until proven guilty.”

Hollis, a 19-year-old sophomore, suffered severe head trauma in a fight that broke out early on the morning of Sept. 28, 2019, on Park Vale Avenue, authorities have said. He died four days later in Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

In February, a Suffolk County grand jury declined to hand up indictments in the case in civilian court.

“As a family, we are incredibly grateful to the NCIS Investigative Team and the Marine Corps prosecuting team for their tireless work and constant communication with our family,” Hollis’s relatives said in a recent statement. “Having experienced the disappointment of the Suffolk County Grand Jury’s decision in February, we were reluctant to share that the case was not over. The current proceedings are part of the public record and we felt it was time to share this news with those who loved Dan and those who have been touched by his story.”

Suffolk DA Rachael Rollins said in February after the civilian grand jury declined to indict that her office respected the panel’s findings, “however difficult they are to hear,” and that the office would “continue to provide all of the resources and support that his loved ones may need as they process and grieve Daniel’s death.”

Hollis’s family said in their statement on the military charges that they miss their loved one every day.

“We know his loss is felt far beyond our immediate family and while nothing will bring him back, there is no longer the frustration and despair that the accused would not be called to account for their actions,” the family said. “It may be later than we had hoped, but the justice system is at work.”

Hollis’s relatives asked for privacy and said the best way “to support us and honor Dan’s memory during this time is to remember the light and goodness Dan brought us every day. Support our foundation as we continue to aid young people in making the world a better place through building community, healthy competition, and fostering curiosity.”





Hollis was found bleeding and unconscious by Boston Police, who responded around 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 28, 2019 to a report of an assault and battery in progress near 15 Park Vale Ave., according to law enforcement officials. London, a Marine visiting Boston on leave, was allegedly linked to the altercation.

The cause of Hollis’s death was blunt force head injuries, according to his death certificate, and police treated his passing as a homicide.

Hollis’s mother, Jennifer Kelly, wrote previously on the website CaringBridge.org that her son and his friends were leaving a party when they were “confronted by another group of college-aged boys.”

“Words were exchanged, pushing/shoving started, and in the scuffle, we believe Dan was hit and subsequently hit his head on cement/bricks as he fell,” Kelly wrote.

A death notice posted last year to the Buma-Sargeant Funeral Home in Milford said Hollis was a 2018 graduate of Hopedale Junior and Senior High School, where he served as his class secretary for six years, was captain of the lacrosse team, and assistant captain for a co-op high school hockey team.

“Daniel was many things, student, athlete, leader, artist, music-lover, friend. He was just 19 years old and only beginning to experience the world around him,” read his death notice.

Marine officials, who publicly identified London in November 2019, said at the time that plans were underway for his separation from the military.

Asked about London’s duty status Monday, a Marines spokesman said London remains assigned to Rifle Company A, 1st Battalion, 25th Marine Regiment located at Fort Devens. His duty status is Selected Marine Corps Reserve, the spokesman said.

Bishop at Mattapan church charged with raping three boys





By John R. Ellement Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 2:08 p.m.



A bishop at the Greater Victory Temple church in Mattapan, who was once considered by parents as a role model for their children, allegedly raped three teenage boys in the church and at his home more than 15 years ago, prosecutors said.

George W. Swain 71, was arraigned via videoconference in Dorchester Municipal Court on multiple charges of rape of a child and indecent assault and battery. Not guilty pleas were entered on behalf of Swain who listened from a Boston hospital where he was being treated for a breathing issue.

In asking that Swain be held on $100,000 cash bail, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Audrey Mark said Swain allegedly sexually assaulted three different boys over varying time periods.



“They were encouraged by their families to spend time in the church because he was seen as a role model,” Mark said of three victims who are now adults. Mark said Swain was a bishop at the church located on Blue Hill Avenue in Mattapan.

The assaults started for one victim when he was 8 years old in 1997, continuing into 2004 when the boy turned 14 years old, and the incidents usually took place at Swain’s home while the child was an overnight guest, the prosecutor said.

The second victim was attacked between the ages of 13 and 16 at the church located on Blue Hill Avenue between the years of 2001 to 2004, Mark said. The prosecutor alleged the boy was assaulted with a sex object; when Boston police searched Swain’s office this week, a sex object was found in his desk, the prosecutor said.

The third boy was allegedly victimized at the church between the ages of 13 and 16 starting in 1997, the prosecutor said.

Swain’s defense attorney, Lauren R. Greenberg, said Swain is a long-time resident of Boston whose age and health condition puts him at risk of developing COVID-19 if he was jailed pending trial. She said he could not afford to post $100,000 cash bail.

Judge Jonathan R. Tynes set bail at $75,000 cash, ordered Swain to stay away from the church and children under the age of 16 and to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet if released.

Swain is due back in court in December.

Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins attended the video hearing but did not speak during the arraignment.

In a statement later, Rollins praised the survivors who came forward in the case.

“It can take decades for victims to make the decision to come forward about sexual abuse, as is what happened here,” Rollins said. “The defendant used his position of trust and authority to ingratiate himself to his victims and their families in order to gain access to vulnerable targets for his sexual abuse. Even more horrific, he used religion as an entryway into these children’s lives, potentially forever altering their faith.”

Numbers listed for Greater Victory Temple weren’t in service Monday afternoon, and an e-mail message to the church seeking comment wasn’t immediately returned.

Greater Victory says on its website that the church has brought “the Word to the community for 19 years,” offering youth group, men and women’s ministries, vacation Bible school, after-school pre-K and summer programs, as well as a children’s choir, sisterhood choir, men’s choir, and praise dancers.

In Boston, councilors propose gender-inclusive city forms and certificates





By Danny McDonald Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 2:43 p.m.



Councilor Michelle Wu is pushing for all city forms, documents, and certificates that have a gender designation to include a non-binary option.Jim Davis/Globe Staff





A pair of Boston city councilors are pushing for all city forms, documents, and certificates that have a gender designation to include a nonbinary option.

Language is important, according to Councilor Michelle Wu, one of the proposal’s backers. Wu recently said multiple constituents have reached out to her to convey that they did not feel their identities were reflected in some city forms.

“We work a lot on the big picture legislation and programs that are pushed out for equity and inclusion and it’s also important that every interaction that people have with city hall reflects that,” said Wu, who is running for mayor, during a brief phone interview last week.



Wu’s proposal states that “social science research has established that the use of gender-inclusive pronouns reduces bias and promotes healthy, positive societal views.”

The city, according to the proposal, has an obligation to ensure that language used on city forms “does not discriminate by sex, social gender or gender and does not perpetuate gender stereotypes but rather reflects the diversity of all our residents.”

Wu sponsored the proposal with Councilor Liz Breadon. The matter is expected to be discussed at Wednesday’s council meeting.

The city initiative comes after state authorities last year started allowing Massachusetts residents to choose a non-binary gender designation on state driver’s licenses.

The state’s Registry of Motor Vehicles now recognizes three gender designation options: “male,” “female,” and “non-binary.” Those options are available for new credentials, renewals, and amendments of licenses and IDs. When Massachusetts made the change, it joined a group of more than a dozen states that allow a third, gender-neutral option on driver’s licenses.

Tre’Andre Valentine, the executive director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, said the proposal was important.

“The city is acknowledging that non-binary people exist and that they’re being included,” said Valentine. “We’ve not really had that before.”

Valentine wanted state authorities to pass similar legislation that would require non-binary options on other documents, like birth certificates and school IDs. Without such options, non-binary people are running to problems because some of their documents have mismatched information, which Valentine said could be “anxiety-inducing.”

“There’s definitely progress here to see they’re thinking of this,” said Valentine of the Boston proposal during a Monday phone interview.

Rhode Island teachers’ unions want to return to remote learning


Two more schools have temporarily halted in-person teaching this week as COVID-19 cases surge


By Dan McGowan Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 11:57 a.m.

PROVIDENCE — The two unions that represent nearly all of Rhode Island’s public school teachers are calling for a “holiday pause” for in-person learning through at least the end of the calendar year as COVID-19 cases continue to surge across the state. Meanwhile, two more schools temporarily halted in-person education because of the coronavirus, and Providence Municipal Court on Sunday announced it has canceled all arraignments and hearings until further notice.

National Education Association Rhode Island President Larry Purtill and Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals President Frank Flynn said Monday that they would like schools to move to full remote learning by Nov. 23, and remain out of school until the new year.



Governor Gina Raimondo has so far been reluctant to close schools amid the spike in COVID-19 cases — last week she said “there isn’t a shred of evidence” that schools are to blame for the increase — but the pressure from the unions likely will make it difficult for her to avoid taking action.

“Rhode Island is experiencing record high number of cases and an overwhelmed Department of Health, despite their best efforts, is falling behind with the required contact tracing that ensures effective quarantining and overall safety of students and educators,” Purtill said in a prepared statement. “Districts already burdened and stretched thin are not equipped, nor do they have the capacity, to take on this duty.”

Rhode Island reported nearly 5,000 new cases between Nov. 6 and Nov. 12, and hospitalizations have increased so dramatically that Raimondo warned last week that the state is at risk of running out of hospital beds within the next month.

Raimondo has been among the most vocal governors in the country when it comes to keeping students in school, but teachers have complained that the state’s system for quarantining close contacts of COVID-19 cases has resulted in massive staff shortages in districts across the state. Several public and private schools or districts have moved to remote learning until at least Nov. 30.

Cranston ordered a temporary move to distance learning last week, but was expected to resume in-person classes this week. On Monday, Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick announced that classes will be held virtually after four students and two staffers tested positive for the disease, authorities said. The all-boys Catholic school in Warwick plans to return to in-person learning on Tuesday if contact tracing can be completed by the end of Monday, the Associated Press reported. Orlo Avenue Elementary School in East Providence is moving to virtual learning until Nov. 30 because of COVID-19-related staffing issues, WJAR-TV reports.

“In August, NEARI and RIFTHP came together to call upon Governor Raimondo and the R.I. Department of Education to meet additional requirements for safety prior to the start of in-person learning and the governor responded,” Flynn said in a statement. “Here we are three months later in a COVID landscape that has gone beyond the original parameters put in place for reopening schools in September and has since exceeded nearly every data threshold. We have a renewed sense of urgency to move to distance learning.”

The unions maintain that the holiday pause would allow the health department to catch up contact tracing and create a system that allows for testing in all schools on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and allow for the installation of air filtration devices that districts ordered earlier this year.

In a statement, Department of Education Emily Crowell declined to directly address the unions’ request.

“We will continue to work with the Department of Health and our colleagues across state government to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in Rhode Island,” Crowell said. “We know that in-person learning is the best option for our kids and that our schools are following rigorous safety protocols in order to support our students and teachers who are in the classroom. We appreciate the hard work and the dedication of our school leaders across the state, who have continued to meet the educational needs of our students despite challenges and changes.”

Mass. reports 1,967 new confirmed coronavirus cases, 12 new deaths





By Martin Finucane Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:30 p.m.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Massachusetts rose by 1,967 Monday, bringing the state’s total to 184,511, the state reported.

The death toll from confirmed cases increased by 12 to 10,110, the Department of Public Health said in its daily report.

The state said 31,768 people were estimated to have active cases of the potentially deadly virus.



Governor Charlie Baker has warned residents to change their behavior in the face of “sustained and troubling” resurgence of the virus in recent weeks. On Friday, he announced the state would reopen a field hospital at the DCU Center in Worcester that will be ready to accept patients the first week of December, if needed.

Earlier this month, the governor imposed tighter restrictions that included requiring most businesses to close by 9:30 p.m. and reducing limits on the size of gatherings. He also modified his mask order to require people to wear masks in public, no matter how far they are from other people.

In the daily report, state officials also said 53,265 more tests had been conducted for coronavirus. The total number of tests administered climbed to more than 7.32 million. New antigen tests had been completed for 3,099 people, bringing that total to 225,360.

The seven-day average rate of positive tests, which is calculated from the total number of tests administered, was at 3.2 percent. The lowest observed figure for that metric — a number watched closely by state officials — is 0.8 percent.

The seven-day average of hospitalized coronavirus patients rose from 665 to 693. The lowest that metric has been is 155.

The seven-day average of deaths from confirmed cases dipped from 23 to 21; the lowest that number has been is 11.

The state recently changed the way it reports some statistics related to positive tests, introducing a new metric that attempts to isolate the effect of public health programs undertaken by colleges, in which asymptomatic people can be tested repeatedly in an effort to rapidly identify new cases.

On Monday, the state said the seven-day positivity rate would be 5.25 percent if not for people tested in higher education settings. However, the state’s overall rate still includes others who might be repeatedly tested, such as health care workers, long-term care providers and residents, and first responders.

Moderna says early data suggest its COVID-19 vaccine is 94.5 percent effective


The first results from the Cambridge company’s late-stage clinical trial show its product has about the same efficacy as a rival one Pfizer’s testing


By Jonathan Saltzman Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 9:35 a.m.

Moderna said Monday that initial data from a late-stage clinical trial indicate that its COVID-19 vaccine was nearly 95 percent effective at preventing infections, a remarkable showing for any vaccine, let alone one based on novel technology.

Although the analysis is preliminary, the Cambridge biotech said it hopes to seek emergency use of the experimental vaccine for some people “in the coming weeks” and expects to have about 20 million doses to ship in the United States by year’s end. That would be enough for 10 million people, given that vaccination requires two doses.

The first interim review of data in the study of more than 30,000 volunteers at 100 trial sites in the country indicated that the vaccine showed about the same effectiveness as a rival one being tested by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. That company reported a week ago that two doses of its vaccine appeared to be more than 90 percent effective.



“This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease,” said Moderna’s chief executive, Stephane Bancel.

Moderna’s stock rose 9.6 percent to $97.95 Monday.

The analysis, done by an independent monitoring board, does not mean an effective vaccine is imminent, but the early results are impressive. The board analyzed the first 95 cases of COVID-19 among volunteers who received two shots four weeks apart and then went about their daily lives. Half of all participants in the trial got the vaccine. The other half got placebo shots.

On Sunday afternoon, the board informed Moderna that only five of the 95 people who caught COVID-19 had gotten the vaccine, said Ray Jordan, a spokesman for the company. The other 90 cases occurred in recipients of the placebo. The results indicate the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent, the company said.

Related: Pfizer says early data signal COVID-19 vaccine is 90 percent effective

“Honestly, I would not have expected that," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an interview with STAT News, responding to the early vaccine data from Moderna and Pfizer. "I thought that was too much to hope for.”

Fauci, the top US infectious-disease doctor, said earlier this year that he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that was 60 percent effective.

The interim analysis reported no significant safety concerns and indicated that the Moderna vaccine was generally well tolerated. Most side effects were mild or moderate and generally short-lived and included symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and achiness.

Moderna officials were particularly delighted by how well the vaccine appeared to prevent severe cases of COVID-19. Eleven of the 95 people infected with the virus in the data snapshot were diagnosed with severe cases. All 11 cases occurred in the placebo group — none in the group that got the vaccine.

The vaccine trial was closely monitored to ensure that participants reflect the country’s diverse population. Moderna has said that minorities make up more than a third of the 30,000-person trial.

“It wasn’t as if the only people who were protected were the young people. There were people in the elderly, there were people in the minorities,” Fauci said in the interview with STAT News. Efficacy was “really consistent across all groups.”

Related: The story of two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, leading the race for approval of a coronavirus vaccine

Based on the data, Moderna said it plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve the vaccine for at least some people on an emergency basis in the coming weeks. It said the FDA would wait for a final analysis of a total of 151 cases of COVID-19 among volunteers in the trial before deciding.

Alan Carr, an analyst, on Monday wrote to investors that the early data represent "an impressive outcome in our opinion, and we believe issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization may be feasible in December.”

The first doses of any vaccine authorized for emergency use are expected to go to people at high risk for catching COVID-19 or for suffering serious complications, including medical workers and the elderly.

Pfizer has said it expects to produce up to 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of the year, 2½ times the amount Moderna hopes to have in the same time frame. Pfizer’s vaccine also requires two shots, so 50 million doses would be enough for 25 million people.

Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines rely on synthetic messenger RNA, an ingenious variation on the natural substance that directs protein production in cells throughout the body. The vaccines contain custom-made messenger molecules that instruct cells to create a part of the coronavirus and then stimulate the immune system to make antibodies. If it works, that would protect people if they ever got infected with the actual virus.

There are a dozen coronavirus vaccine candidates in late-stage trials globally, and they employ a variety of approaches. The US government’s Operation Warp Speed has bankrolled a handful of vaccine candidates with billions of dollars.

The government has pledged up to $2.48 billion to Moderna to develop its vaccine and provide at least 100 million doses. Pfizer opted not to take any federal money upfront but will, along with its German partner, BioNTech, receive $1.95 billion from the government to produce at least 100 million doses if the vaccine gets approved.

What is an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine?

Dr. Paul Offit, an authority on vaccines at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the preliminary results from the Moderna study are “very encouraging” and validate the data that Pfizer released Nov. 9. He was particularly impressed that none of the volunteers who suffered severe cases of COVID-19 had received the vaccine.

Nonetheless, he noted that no messenger RNA vaccine or drug has won approval before and said it was premature to celebrate.

“You’d like to see all the data rather than the data that companies put out by press releases,” he said.

Moderna also reported Monday that its vaccine candidate remains stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 days, up from the company’s previous estimate of seven days. And it remains stable for up to six months in a freezer set at minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit, the company said.

One of the concerns about the messenger RNA vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech is that it must be kept at minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. Those cold-storage requirements have raised serious questions about whether hospitals could safely store the vaccine and how easily it could be shipped around the world.

The ability to store the Moderna vaccine in commonly used pharmaceutical freezers and refrigerators “would enable simpler distribution and [provide] more flexibility to facilitate wider-scale vaccination in the United States and other parts of the world,” said Juan Andres, chief of technical operations at Moderna.

The preliminary data appeared to buoy hopes as the pandemic surges in various parts of the world, including the United States, where the virus has caused at least 246,000 deaths.

Like the leaders of other companies testing experimental vaccines, Moderna’s Bancel has said it will take more than one approved COVID-19 vaccine to tame the pandemic; no single company can produce enough doses to protect the world’s 7.8 billion people.

If Moderna’s vaccine ultimately wins FDA approval, it would represent a singular achievement for a company that has generated high hopes but had its doubters. Founded a decade ago, Moderna raised more than $2 billion in venture capital and partnership funds before going public in 2018, based on the promise of its mRNA technology.

The company raised more than $600 million in the initial public offering, which shattered the record for the largest biotech IPO in history. Nonetheless, Moderna has no approved products — not unheard of among high-flying biotechs — and has struggled to create a fleet of mRNA medicines that could be safely dosed repeatedly.

“It’s increasingly evident that the coronavirus vaccine will be its first product, and it will probably be a significant revenue generator in the near-term,” Carr, the analyst, said. “But in the long term I think it’s a good indicator for the rest of their infectious disease pipeline.”

Moderna is working on mRNA vaccines for a host of other diseases, including the flu and serious respiratory illnesses, he said, and will need some to succeed to sustain its impressive market value of more than $38 billion.

‘These inequities are heartbreaking’: AG Healey urges action on health care disparities





By Anissa Gardizy Globe Correspondent,Updated November 16, 2020, 12:05 p.m.



In May, Black and Latinx activists marched to the State House to advocate for communities of color, who they said were disproportionately affected by the state’s reopening plans.Blake Nissen for the Boston Globe





Attorney General Maura Healey put out a report Monday outlining her recommendations for reducing the inequities Black, Hispanic, and Latinx communities face in the Massachusetts health care system during the pandemic.

The report hinges on the fact that communities of color have experienced “significantly higher infection rates, hospitalization rates, and age-adjusted death rates than other communities, and are more vulnerable to the economic impacts of the virus.”

“These inequities are heartbreaking, and they are not new, of course,” Healey said on a Zoom call. “What COVID-19 did was amplify, reveal, and certainly exacerbate the health care disparities that have existed in our society from the beginning. Now is the time for us to address that.”



Healey identified five steps to tackle the problems: Collect better data on patients' races and ethnicities; track the distribution of resources; expand access to telehealth services; diversify the state’s health care workforce; and invest in areas that affect health, such as education and housing.

Healey announced the initiative alongside local health care leaders, who shared their perspectives on how the pandemic has affected people in the state.

During the call, Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said some immigrants have hesitated to be tested for the coronavirus, for fear it may trigger a response from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She said others have worried about being out of work without paid sick leave, especially if that affects their ability to afford housing.

“The larger theme . . . is that our health response really can’t be divorced from public policy,” Saadi said. “We can’t solve these problems alone as health care professionals.”

Also discussed on the Monday call: ensuring that the state is committed to an equitable strategy for distributing a COVID-19 vaccine when it is ready. Healey urged the Department of Public Health to collect data on the race and ethnicity of all recipients so it can determine whether enough vaccine is reaching low-income populations and communities of color.

“The data element is at the core,” said Frank Robinson, vice president of public health at Baystate Health, during the call. “I expect that we will have in place, by April, a community-facing health equity dashboard that will allow us to measure and watch the distribution of COVID vaccines.”

New England ski resorts expect huge demand this season, but capacity will be limited





By Andy Rosen Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:16 p.m.

WESTMINSTER — There’s no snow on the ground at Wachusett Mountain Ski Area, but it’s already crawling with people. Hikers make their way up and down bare trails, examine chairlifts with curiosity, and peer longingly into a lodge that hasn’t opened for the season.

Mountain sports have long been popular with those who can afford them during New England’s long winters. But this year, as COVID-19 continues to limit indoor gatherings, its appeal is only growing.

That would normally be good news for ski resorts, which report sky-high interest in advance tickets and season passes. But for an industry trying to recover after the pandemic forced ski areas to close early this spring, the continued threat of the virus means severe limits on how many paying customers will be allowed.



“We’re their psychological shelter,” Carolyn Stimpson, co-owner of family-owned Wachusett, said of skiers anxious to hit the slopes. The ski area is getting lots of inquiries from people in Boston and Worcester who might not normally ski, or who would usually travel out of state if not for pandemic travel restrictions.

“They need the endorphins from being outside. They need the sun. They need the wind in their faces,” Stimpson said. “All we’re trying to do is figure out how to give them the opportunity.”

The mountain will probably have to operate at about half its normal capacity of 4,200, even as it spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on improvements to accommodate social distancing. It has amassed an armada of heat lamps and picnic tables for outdoor dining, built a new deck on the ski rental building that allows customers to gather their gear outside, and brought in a fleet of portable toilets to keep too many people from congregating indoors.

Lindsay DesLauriers, president of Bolton Valley Resort in Vermont, not far from Burlington, said the prospect of not being able to welcome everyone who wants to visit is maddening.

"It’s a terrible, terrible irony,” DesLauriers said. “Typically, we love to see growing demand, because it means more business. But, no matter where we look, we’re restricting that business.”

Many in the industry note that skiing is an activity that isn’t likely to spread a virus. It takes place outside, often under windy conditions. People are mostly distanced from each other, and they usually cover their mouths and noses to stay warm.

Chairlifts, gondolas, ski rental shops, and lodges, however, can create major bottlenecks.

Resorts are limiting the number of people who can ride on a lift. Those who come together can ride in groups, but singles lines — which allow solo riders to mix in with other customers — can’t be used to pack the seats.

And though many resorts will open their lodges with social-distancing measures in place, people are being discouraged from hanging around or enjoying long lunches or apres-ski beverages. Ski areas also are urging people to get themselves and their gear ready in their cars, and to expect to remain mostly outside.

To limit crowds, resorts such as Wachusett are also imploring customers to buy tickets or make reservations in advance. There may not be room for those who simply show up.

Some of the changes to the way the industry will operate this year also threaten to make skiing, already an expensive sport, even more prohibitive. People who can afford season passes will have an advantage over other skiers in some places. Many resorts are giving priority to holders of season passes, who spend thousands of dollars to get access to a mountainside.

“Places are almost pricing out anyone who doesn’t want to buy a season pass,” said Bryan Hickey, ski program and marketing manager at the Boston Ski and Sports Club, which has been arranging trips from the city to the mountains for a quarter-century.

This year, the group is trying to find ways to help customers navigate the added complexities by securing group rates and arranging socially distanced transportation and lodging.

Vail Resorts, the Colorado conglomerate that owns New England properties such as Vermont’s Mount Snow and Stowe and New Hampshire’s Attitash and Wildcat, told investors in September that its sales of season passes were up 18 percent, compared with last year.

The company is putting season holders and people who buy multi-day lift ticket packages first when it comes to making room at its mountains, giving them exclusive rights to early-season skiing and special access to reservations for skiing and boarding during the peak season.

Jamie Storrs, spokesman for Vail Resorts, said the company is doing what it can to stick by its most loyal customers during a difficult year. He said people will still be able to buy single-day tickets, starting Dec. 8.

Another factor making it difficult for casual skiers this year is the uncertainty around interstate travel.

Maine and Vermont have already issued strict quarantine and testing rules on travelers from Massachusetts, making spur-of-the moment travel impossible. New Hampshire has no such policy currently in place, but if the COVID-19 crisis worsens, that could change. Or Massachusetts could toughen its rules for residents returning from those states.

To avoid the risk of being unable to ski, some people who have the financial means are planning to take off for the winter altogether. Many resorts have converted some of their hotel rooms into private “cabanas," where people can live and work remotely from the slopes for the whole season.

At Bolton Valley, DesLauriers said it has already sold out all of the 17 cabanas that the property prepared for the season.

She said she’s sympathetic to the efforts to prevent people from bringing the virus to Vermont. But those measures come at a price for the resort.

“We need them to be able to come and ski, so I would say that I’m generally supportive, and I would just hope that our out-of-state guests don’t get demoralized,” she said.

Bolton Valley expects revenue to be weaker than last season, which was down because it was cut short when the pandemic arrived.

Brian Bernatchez, a financial planner who lives in Belgrade, Maine, will be decamping to a second home that he and his wife, Amy, own near the Sugarloaf resort, a little over an hour away, returning sporadically for work.

He’s excited about the weekdays, when he’ll have the slopes mostly to himself, free from concerns about COVID-19 and long lift lines. But he recognizes that his state’s economy will be better off if the resorts can find a way to serve as many skiers as possible.

“It will never survive just on season pass holders,” Bernatchez said. “When you’re in the middle of Northwestern Maine, you need people to come from all over on the weekends in order to make it a survivable business model.”

SEC chairman to step down at end of the year





By Hannah Denham Washington Post,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:40 p.m.



Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Monday he would step down at the end of this year.

Clayton, a longtime corporate lawyer, was appointed by President Trump in May 2017 and was one of the commission’s longest serving chairs.

''Working alongside the incredibly talented and driven women and men of the SEC has been the highlight of my career,'' he said in a statement.



During his tenure, Clayton emphasized protecting retail investors and drew praise for tackling complex market issues. The agency also cracked down on cryptocurrency scams, filing numerous cases over the last few years.

But consumer advocates have said some of the SEC policies under his leadership could hurt consumers in the long run, including allowing more companies to raise money without traditional oversight. They have been particularly critical of a rule requiring brokers not put their own interests before those of their clients, which they say is too weak.

One of Clayton’s most high-profile targets was Elon Musk, when the SEC sued him as chairman of Tesla for allegedly lying to investors when he tweeted that he had ''funding secured'' to take Tesla private, in September 2018. The enforcement action resulted in a settlement requiring a $20 million fine against Musk, a separate $20 million from Tesla, two new independent directors added to the board, and higher scrutiny of Musk’s public communications.

''I am proud of our collective efforts to advance each part of the SEC’s tripartite mission, always with an eye on the interests of our Main Street investors,'' Clayton said.

While he escaped controversy most of his tenure, Clayton was thrust into the spotlight last year when Trump announced his intention to nominate him as the next US attorney for the Southern District of New York, sparking a battle for control of the office.

Clayton didn’t address his future plans in the statement.

Before the SEC, Clayton, a longtime partner with Sullivan & Cromwell, had never held a government position and had represented some of the biggest names in the financial world, including Goldman Sachs and Bill Ackman of Pershing Capital.

In a statement, the SEC cited several accomplishments under Clayton’s leadership, including rules that make it easier for businesses to raise capital in public and private markets and improved examination and enforcement programs. During his tenure, the SEC returned about $3.5 billion to harmed investors and paid about $565 million to whistleblowers.

It is unclear who President-elect Joe Biden could nominate to be the next SEC chair. The nominee would have to be confirmed by the Senate.

Mass tourism will be roaring back by summer, Expedia CEO says





By Nikki Ekstein Bloomberg,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:11 p.m.



Things are looking good for Expedia Group. Well, relatively, anyway.

Its third-quarter earnings report shows a company that’s still pulling in $1.5 billion in quarterly revenue, exceeding mid-pandemic expectations, even if that it represents $221 million in losses. Parts of the business, such as airfare sales, may have tanked, but others, like rental home platform VRBO, are compensating.

Instead of looking back at the last few months of bumpy business, though, Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern, who assumed leadership of the company in April, would rather look forward. Even in comparison to other bullish industry leaders, Kern is steadfast in his conviction that travel’s recovery isn’t just on the horizon but around the corner. And it won’t be just on forested hiking trails and scenic byways but in big, dense, boarded-up cities, too.



“Rome has been through a plague or two,” he says, repeating an idea he’s expressed during many engagements through the pandemic. “And it’s still there. New York has been through all kinds of things. It’s not the first time we’ve had civil unrest,” he explains. “It was a much different place, in terms of safety, when I was growing up in the ’70s, yet we still went there.”

And while it’s true that a quieter New York still holds the vibrancy of many small towns combined, Kern feels that this arc of history will bend sharper and faster toward full recovery than any before. “This is a time with more science, more technology. We’re not going to give up.

“This is just one man’s opinion,” he continues. “This [process] will be less than the three to five years others are predicting. If you said tomorrow that there was a vaccine with 100 percent efficacy, and everyone gets it, do people want to live on a cul-de-sac or in a city? They’d rush back and realize there was a reason they weren’t living in a cul-de-sac before.”

Dim prospects for the suburbs aside, here are Kern’s broader (and rosier) predictions for the short-term future of travel, from a due-any-minute spike in bookings to a “re-upping” of investment into urban restaurants and culture.

Kern firmly holds that news of an impending vaccine — rather than the vaccine itself — is what will jump-start travel again. “People will think, ‘Well, by the summer Europe might be open, or I might have the vaccine, so let’s book it,’” he explains.

Pfizer’s announcement last week that its vaccine candidate was 90 percent effective has not yet shown a quantifiable impact on Expedia’s sales, but it did send the company’s stock price up 22.5 percent that morning — along with similar spikes for such travel companies as Marriott International and Park Hotels & Resorts.

A shift in consumer confidence doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s been steadily rising, Kern says.

“Barring the vaccine, my sense is that people were getting increasingly comfortable with how safe air travel and hotels are —the precautions that the industry has been taking —and the numbers [of bookings] have been creeping up,” he says. “Of course, it helps if everybody does their part” to keep the virus in check.

The latter half of that thought is crucial: Trusting in airline and hotel protocols matters only when people are physically able to travel. With a second wave forcing lockdowns in much of Europe (and possibly the United States, soon), consumer confidence may well be a moot point.

Like others in the industry, though, Kern sees his decent-enough summer sales as proof that there is pent-up demand and reason to be hopeful that business can swell quickly again. “It’s all terrible — but it’s way less terrible than one might have imagined,” he concedes.

Airbnb files for IPO




Airbnb Inc., in a long-awaited filing for an initial public offering, outlined widening losses and plunging revenue while projecting optimism for a rebound in demand for home-sharing when the economy eventually recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. The listing is set to be one of the biggest this year. The company’s filing Monday showed that gross booking value for the nine months ended Sept. 30 tumbled to $18 billion, down almost 40 percent from the same period last year, it said. Airbnb had a net loss of $697 million on revenue of $2.5 billion for that nine-month period, compared with a net loss of $323 million on revenue of $3.7 billion for the same period last year, according to the filing. People familiar with the company’s plans have said it will seek to raise as much as $3 billion in an IPO in December. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Home Depot Inc. agreed to buy building products distributor HD Supply, reuniting the home-improvement retailer with its former subsidiary more than a decade after they split apart. Home Depot will buy all outstanding shares for about $56 apiece, according to a statement Monday, representing a premium of about 25 percent over HD Supply’s closing price on Friday. With about 156 million shares outstanding, according to a filing, the offer is valued at roughly $8.7 billion. Including net cash, the deal has an enterprise value of about $8 billion, the companies said. The acquisition brings back together two companies that used to be under the same roof and will give Home Depot more exposure to the professional contractor side of the business.

Black Friday plus COVID-19 add up to crunch time for retailers





By Jordyn Holman and Kim Bhasin Bloomberg,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:33 p.m.



Holiday shopping trends are changing this year during the COVID-19 pandemic, making retailers nervous, but Christmas decorations were still put up in Cambridgeside Plaza.David L. Ryan/Globe Staff





(Bloomberg) — The formula for retailers on Black Friday is usually pretty simple: Cut prices, stock shelves, prepare for crowds, and make sure orders arrive on time. This year — like everything in 2020 — it’s anything but.

America’s biggest apparel retailers and department stores are anxious ahead of the crucial holiday period. That’s because all the new tools they’ve hastily rolled out and scaled up amid the global pandemic, like in-store and curbside pickup and direct shipping from stores, haven’t really been battle-tested. So if they fail, an already disastrous year could get that much worse.

“These companies are used to somewhat regular patterns,” said David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings Inc. “All of that has gone out of the window.”



Companies have laid out how they’re getting ready: Kohl’s chief executive Michelle Gass, for example, said she’s pushing shoppers to retrieve their online purchases at stores, instead of getting them shipped to their homes. This would relieve the company’s distribution centers. Old Navy chief executive Nancy Green, meanwhile, said the budget apparel chain is shipping more products directly from stores to customers' homes.

But it’s clear that this year is different. Levi Strauss & Co. chief executive Chip Bergh has said he’s concerned enough about the potential crunch around the holidays that he may move the guaranteed ship-by date a week earlier than usual. That means the window of time around the holidays in which shipping times aren’t guaranteed, due to the high volume of orders, would start earlier this year.

Data show companies have cause for concern. More than half of US shoppers said they wouldn’t buy from a store again if they were unsatisfied with the delivery experience, according to a September survey from Accenture. Online sales are expected to spike 33 percent to $189 billion, testing the limits of fulfillment networks across the US, according to Adobe Analytics.

Shares of Amazon and essential retailers like Target and Walmart have gained this year, while department stores and apparel chains have slumped amid declining sales. Many of these non-essential retailers closed down during the lockdown earlier in 2020 and used that time to refine their e-commerce operations with an eye on the holiday season.

But Fitch’s Silverman said he’s concerned that new programs adopted by retailers may not be precise enough for them to accurately report inventory and limit delays and snags, which could potentially impact sales.

Additionally, consumer habits are changing dramatically during the pandemic, and many industry observers say that shifts toward e-commerce and socially distanced shopping methods could be permanent. So if shoppers don’t have a good experience, retailers risk losing them for good.

Department stores in particular want to keep shoppers happy. It’s been one of the worst performing areas in retail, and Macy’s and Kohl’s — both of which report earnings this week — have shed more than $7 billion in market value this year. The mandatory lockdowns erased millions in sales earlier this year.

Big-box stores Walmart and Target, which have benefitted from pantry loading this year, also report quarterly results this week. The latest round of disclosures is expected to shed light on how retailers are handling shipping and higher demand in the final weeks of 2020.

Companies should be ready for a flood of shoppers picking up orders, both inside stores and outside in the parking lot. Analysts at Adobe Analytics expect pickup lines to lengthen as Christmas approaches and usage of pickup options to spike 40 percent compared to last year, surpassing standard mail shipping as the most popular buying option.

At the same time, higher levels of e-commerce will strain traditional carriers like FedEx and United Parcel Service, which retailers fear may limit shipping capacity from stores as orders ramp up.

Roadie, a crowd-sourced last-mile delivery platform that works with companies like Walmart, Home Depot, and Tractor Supply, has been getting more calls from retailers asking for help to fulfill same-day orders. It now works with an additional 5,000 store locations — up more than 250 percent since the start of the pandemic.

“You will see a pretty large clog in the system once you get past Thanksgiving,” chief executive Marc Gorlin said. “The burden is on retailers.”

Analyzing every one of the NHL’s new ‘reverse retro’ jerseys





By Matt Porter Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 3:04 p.m.



A model wears the Bruins' "reverse retro" jersey that was unveiled Monday.NHL





The NHL and Adidas released new jerseys for every team Monday, which was exciting for two reasons: It gave hockey fans something to kick around in the depths of the strangest offseason ever, and it reminded us that, eventually, we’ll get to see players wear them in games.

The assignment here for the teams, working in conjunction with Adidas, was to come up with a “reverse retro” jersey, to be worn a handful of times each season. Some clubs took that literally — such as the Blues, Ducks, and Bruins, who took old jerseys and switched up the colors.



Other teams melded eras. Some teams brought back a look from a city they used to play in. Then there’s whatever the Red Wings were trying to accomplish.

An instant critique of each new sweater:





ANAHEIM DUCKS

Super Wild Wing! Reminds us of Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya ripping it up on the Pond. A very unusual font. However, the reversing of the colors creates this odd detail: Instead of blasting his way out of frozen (white) ice, the mascot is … emerging from the (teal) ocean, with a few ice cubes around him. Let’s not think about this too deeply (spoiler: we are going to be thinking about this too deeply).





ARIZONA COYOTES





Is it 2021 yet? pic.twitter.com/IPW7rBvlXR

— Arizona Coyotes (@ArizonaCoyotes) November 16, 2020





Better than the Coyotes' original third jersey, which had a green desert sky with a kachina head and cacti and mesas and such. This time, the sky is nighttime purple. A winner on every front, right down to the gecko shoulder patch and the community color unity with the purple-and-orange NBA Suns.





BOSTON BRUINS




Very yellow, and not in a Pooh Bear kind of way. It’s just a straight color swap of the unis the Bruins wore in the final 20 seasons of the Old Garden, complete with the simple, non-serifed Spoked-B crest and frazzled-looking bear on the shoulder. Recalls the black-and-white TV days of the ’50s, when the Bruins wore uncomplicated yellow jerseys at home.

Overall? A significant upgrade over any of the alternate jerseys the Bruins have had, and probably will look very good on the ice.

Sharp logo (yeah, yeah) and colors that make it clear you’re watching the Sabres. Take away the “BUFFALO” on the waist and it’s better. Given their history of alternate unis, pretty good.

Not looking a gift horse in the mouth here, the Flames took the opportunity to bring back Blasty, their fire-breathing mascot from the original third-jersey days (the mid-'90s trend that gave us Wild Wing, Pooh Bear, the LA Burger King, and Lady Liberty on a formerly bland batch of NHL sweaters). It’s black. It’s aggressive. A proper third jersey for a club that went red-and-yellow retro with its home and away sweaters.

Masters takeaways: After a 12th-hole disaster, Tiger Woods delivered one of the classiest moments of his career





By Jim Hoban Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 9:03 a.m.



Tiger Woods graciously slipped the green jacket on Dustin Johnson after his record-setting performance.Patrick Smith/Getty





I’ll remember the 2020 pandemic Masters for more than Dustin Johnson’s record-setting victory; it was one of the classiest moments in Tiger Woods’s legendary career.

Woods strolled to the par-3, 148-yard 12th hole at 3 under on Sunday, with no chance to win. His tee shot spun off the green and into the water. He went to the drop area and hit it into the water again. He sailed one into the back bunker, and from a difficult lie, rinsed another Bridgestone. When he left the 12th green, he had posted a 10, easily the highest number he has shot on one hole in his major championship history.



He didn’t spit in the cup, as a petulant Sergio Garcia has done; he didn’t throw a club, as Jon Rahm is prone to do; he didn’t throw a hissy-fit, a la Bubba Watson; and he didn’t make excuses, like Bryson DeChambeau.

With nothing to play for — Woods has a lifetime exemption into the Masters — he birdied five of his last six holes to finish the tournament most associated with his historic accomplishments at 1 under, in the red, his preferred color on Sunday.

“Well, I committed to the wrong wind,” he told CBS’s Amanda Balionis during an interview after his round of 76, which left him in a tie for 38th.

Woods’s win at Augusta in 1997 was historic; he won a major on a broken knee; even last year’s victory at the Masters was considered by some the greatest comeback story in golf history, although Tiger disagreed. “One of the greatest comebacks in all of sports is the gentleman who won here, Mr. Hogan,” Woods said after he won the Masters in a stunner in 2019. “I mean, he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships.”





Woods, now an elder statesman in the game, has never showed more character, win or lose. Put Sunday’s comeback on a list of his great comebacks. (Note to DeChambeau: It’s called not giving up, no matter how you feel.)

Other takeaways from the final major of the COVID-19 season:

▪ Johnson was understandably emotional after capturing his first green jacket and the second major of his estimable career. I can’t help but think Brooks Koepka’s stinging comments before the final round of the 2020 PGA Championship, in which DJ shared the lead, has fueled Johnson’s fire. (Koepka said Johnson was not a good closer.)

For the record, the major championship score this season is Johnson 1, Loudmouth 0.

Related: Sullivan: Dustin Johnson lets his emotions spill out after Masters victory

▪ Before the Masters, DeChambeau put a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of pressure on his well-rounded shoulders by saying Augusta was playing as a par 67 for him — a reference to how he thought he would dominate the par 5s.

The golf gods were listening.

DeChambeau doubled the par-5 13th in the first round and although he played the par 5s in 9 under for the week, the other 14 holes were a bit more difficult for him. He made 11 bogeys, two doubles, and a triple for the week. DJ had just four bogeys all week, a record for a Masters champ.

Is anyone else sick of Big D’s excuses? He isn’t feeling well? He’s 27 and consumes 5,000 calories a day, tirelessly pushing his body to extremes. Bernhard Langer is 63 and the oldest player to make the cut at the Masters. Any 60-year-old will tell you that everything aches when you hit that age. Going head-to-head in the same threesome on Sunday, Langer (-3) beat DeChambeau (-2). Only at the Masters. I have Langer in a sit-up contest, too.

▪ Does it look like Phil Mickelson is done? Only four players to make the cut finished worse than Lefty, who grinded to a 79-73 weekend. Mickelson, 50, is 2 for 2 on the Champions Tour. Just saying.

▪ DJ laid up on both par 5s on the back nine. It was smart course management with a three-shot lead, which he made five shots by the time he putted out on No. 15. He certainly is playing and thinking like a different golfer.

▪ Sungjae Im is a fairways machine. Last year’s PGA Tour Rookie of the Year shared the B flight title with Cameron Smith, at 15 under. Smith hit only 64 percent of the fairways for the week (36 of 56); Im hit 82 percent (46 of 56).

▪ Smith became the first player in Masters history to shoot all four rounds in the 60s.

▪ One sobering thought: Johnson (36), Webb Simpson (35), and Rory McIlroy (31) are the only players in the top 10 over the age of 30.

▪ It’s November and we’re in a pandemic, and it will likely never happen, but two PGA events at Augusta wouldn’t be the worst thing for golf, would it? Better yet, how about an LPGA major at Augusta National?

Between the NBA draft and free agency, it’s a busy week for the Celtics. Here’s what they’re preparing for





By Adam Himmelsbach Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 7:15 p.m.



Gordon Hayward (20) and Enes Kanter (11) must decide this week on their player options.Michael Dwyer/Associated Press





In most years, mid-November is a relatively quiet time for Celtics coach Brad Stevens to start fine-tuning his rotation and for president of basketball operations Danny Ainge to start wondering about potential upgrades. But this mid-November week will be unlike any the NBA has ever seen.

On Monday, teams were allowed to begin making trades. The draft will be held Wednesday, and free agency will open Friday. Also, players such as Gordon Hayward and Enes Kanter will make decisions this week about whether to pick up their player options for this season. It’s expected to be a frenetic week, but when it is over there should finally be some clarity regarding the makeup of Boston’s roster.



“There are some challenges there for sure,” Celtics director of player personnel Austin Ainge said Monday. “It always comes fast, always feels like that even in a normal year. The coaching staff definitely has some issues, and there could definitely be deals with guys we sign who can’t test and quarantine in time to join camp. There definitely will be challenges down the road. But in terms of roster construction, we’re used to working at a frenzied pace and everything happening at once in a normal year.”

Ainge has been primarily focused on Wednesday’s draft, which probably presents the most unusual challenges of the week. When evaluating free agents, the Celtics generally have an extensive portfolio to consult. But after the college basketball season was halted because of COVID-19 in March, there was no NCAA Tournament, no NBA combine, and no individual prospect visits.

As the Celtics figure out how to maneuver with the 14th, 26th, 30th, and 47th picks, they will have to put added trust in their film evaluations and virtual draft workouts that they watched on their computers.

“The [normal] draft workout process is great for us,” Ainge said. “We like it. It’s not everything, but it helps to have guys in and put them in situations that we didn’t get to see in college. If a guy is not a great shooter, we have him shoot a lot. If a guy is not great at running pick-and-rolls, we put him in a lot of pick-and-rolls. If we’re worried about his closeouts, we put him in closeout drills. These types of things are helpful to get a little more info and we weren’t able to do that this year. So we’ve got to go off of film a little more.”

Related: When it comes to the NBA draft, your guess is probably as good as most teams

Overseas scouting is one of Ainge’s primary responsibilities. Typically, he crisscrosses the globe in search of hidden gems. But that option was halted, along with the games.

Ainge said that context is important when scouting players overseas. While a college star’s role is quite clear, a young player with heaps of potential overseas might not receive a substantial role on a veteran-laden squad that is built to win. Ainge’s visits help him filter through that noise.

“Sometimes they get the keys to the kingdom and other times they are expected to sit in on a very veteran team,” he said. “So you just have to do a little more work to understand the situation compared to college.”

Ainge does not expect the looming decisions of Hayward and Kanter to affect Boston’s approach to the draft. He said they could have a greater impact on how it attempts to proceed in the trade market, however. If the Celtics look to acquire a star veteran using their picks, they likely will need Hayward’s $34.1 million salary for matching purposes. But they could not trade Hayward unless he opted in first, and he’d have to have some reason to agree to that.

With the Celtics holding three first-round picks and admittedly having little desire to add three rookies to their young team, they are expected to look for ways to get creative on draft night. They could package picks to move up, select a player to stash overseas, or even trade out of this draft and into a future one.

Those decisions sometimes hinge on the availability of a player the Celtics are interested in, but Boston does not have a draft-night playbook for the other 29 teams, so there is some guesswork.

“I remember we felt decently confident we knew how it would go in the top couple in the Jayson Tatum draft, but most of the time that’s even hard,” Ainge said. “It’s not something you usually count on when you’re trying to trade up in drafts, let’s say to even the fifth pick or eighth pick or 12th pick. You really don’t know, so you just either wait until it’s on the clock or you have multiple guys you like, so you’re fine with whoever is left.”

NFL Week 10: This looks like the best weekend in history for kickers





By Ben Volin Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 4:29 p.m.



Buffalo's Tyler Bass (center) connected on three field goals from beyond 50 yards.Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press





November 15 should henceforth be a national holiday: Kicker Appreciation Day.

Kyler Murray’s Hail Mary touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins was the talk of the NFL in Week 10, but it was the kickers who really stole the show. This past weekend was, without hyperbole, the greatest exhibition of field goal kicking in NFL history. And we have the stats to back it up.

The amazing kicking display is where we begin the Week 10 review:



▪ Kickers connected on 49 of 53 field goal attempts (entering Monday’s game), for a 92.5 success rate that counts as the 13th-best weekend in history. But that’s not why it was the best ever.

The kickers didn’t hit just chip shots; they went a perfect 11 for 11 from 50-plus yards, making it the best long-distance weekend in league history, dating to 1938. The previous best was Week 5 of 2011, when kickers went 10 for 10.

Buffalo’s Tyler Bass tied an NFL record by going 3 for 3 from 50-plus, connecting from 54, 55, and 58 yards, the last of which came as time expired in the second quarter. Seattle’s Jason Myers hit a 61-yarder at the end of the second quarter. And Detroit’s Matt Prater connected from 53 and 59 yards, the latter of which came as time expired to lead the Lions to victory. Prater’s kick tied for the fourth-longest game-winner in NFL history.

Perhaps it’s because the NFL has never had more teams with indoor stadiums (11), but this has been a banner year for kickers. They are on pace for an NFL-record 125 field goals from 50-plus, and the 69.6 percent conversion rate would be the best in history. Overall, kickers have hit 85.4 percent of all field goal attempts this year, which would be the second-best rate (86.5 in 2013).

So go out today and hug your kicker. He deserves it.

▪ Those offseason trades for Hopkins and Stefon Diggs sure are working out well for the Cardinals and Bills. They rank 1-2 in the NFL in catches and yards, and both receivers dazzled in Sunday’s incredible 32-30 win for the Cardinals.

Hopkins made the catch of the year on the 43-yard Hail Mary, outjumping three Bills defenders to come down with the winning touchdown with two seconds left. Hopkins had seven catches for 127 yards on the day, and the Cardinals are 4-1 when he goes for 100 yards.



DEANDRE HOPKINS CATCHES THE HAIL MARY FOR THE WIN! 🚨

— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 16, 2020





Diggs, who leads the NFL with 73 catches for 906 yards, had an incredible, sliding 21-yard touchdown catch in the final minute that should have been the game-winner, and he also opened up the field for Cole Beasley, who had 11 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown.

TOUCHDOWN!



And the @BuffaloBills take the lead!

The Cardinals and Bills are a combined 13-6 and are well on their way to the playoffs. The Texans and Vikings, who traded the two receivers, are 5-12.

▪ The Seahawks are letting Russell Wilson cook, but he’s burning the meal. Wilson threw two more interceptions in Sunday’s 23-16 loss to the Rams that knocked the 6-3 Seahawks from first to third place in the NFC West.

The Seahawks have lost two in a row and three of four (all three losses on the road), and Wilson has thrown seven interceptions in those four games. He has 10 picks this year, tied for second most in the NFL. Wilson’s MVP candidacy is taking a big hit.

▪ Tom Brady and the Bucs got back on track with a 46-23 thrashing of the Panthers. Brady had a near-perfect day, throwing for 341 yards, with three touchdowns and no picks, and the Bucs scored points on their final nine drives.

Brady got all of his receivers involved, too; Chris Godwin had six catches for 92 yards, Mike Evans had six for 77 and a touchdown, Antonio Brown had seven for 69, and Rob Gronkowski had two for 51 and a touchdown.

But Brady probably feels a little frustrated by the performance. The Bucs went 2 for 5 in goal-to-go situations before scoring a couple of late touchdowns, and had to settle for field goals of 21, 23, and 24 yards. The Bucs' offense looks like it still hasn’t quite clicked.

▪ Let’s give it up for Washington’s Alex Smith, who continues his remarkable return from a devastating leg injury that nearly required amputation and could have cost him his life.

Starting his first game since Week 11 of 2018, Smith set career highs in completions (38), attempts (55), and yards (390) in a 30-27 loss to Detroit.

Smith has pretty much cemented his claim to the Comeback Player of the Year Award. And Washington won’t be an easy opponent with Smith leading the way.

▪ It was a leather-helmet kind of win for the Browns, who defeated the Texans, 10-7. Playing in a horrific downpour, Browns running backs Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt each rushed for more than 100 yards with more than 5.0 yards per carry, becoming the first Browns teammates to do so since Ernie Green and Leroy Kelly in 1966.

And the game took just 2 hours 35 minutes, the sixth-quickest NFL game since 2000 and the quickest since the Bears beat the Vikings in 2:22 in 2009.

▪ What a week for bad betting beats. With the Browns listed as 4½-point favorites, Chubb ran out of bounds at the 1 instead of scoring a touchdown in the final seconds to preserve a 10-7 win. And Arizona, listed as a 2- to 3-point favorite, opted to take a knee on its last-second extra point to preserve a 32-30 win.

Both decisions were correct; Chubb prevented the Texans from getting the ball back, while Arizona prevented the Bills from blocking the extra point and returning it for 2 points. But a lot of bettors weren’t happy.





Quick hits




▪ Who needs practice? Ben Roethlisberger threw for 333 yards and four touchdowns in a blowout win over the Bengals despite barely practicing last week because of COVID-19 quarantining.

▪ Drew Brees will miss time with fractured ribs and a collapsed lung, but the Saints are 5-1 when he misses a game with an injury. All five wins came last year with Teddy Bridgewater at QB.

▪ Teams that may have peaked too early: Titans, Packers, Ravens. Combined record of 12-1 the first five weeks, 7-7 the last five weeks.





Tracking Ex-Patriots




▪ Bucs QB Tom Brady: Has 23 touchdown passes in 10 games, after throwing 24 in 16 last year.

▪ Bucs TE Rob Gronkowski: Caught a TD pass for the fourth time in five games.

▪ Dolphins CB Eric Rowe, LB Elandon Roberts, and LB Kyle Van Noy: Combined for 18 tackles and three QB hits against the Chargers and rank second, third, and fourth on the team in tackles.

▪ Lions LB Jamie Collins: Had a team-high 13 tackles, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery against Washington. His two forced fumbles came within four snaps in the second quarter.





Ex-Patriots coaches




▪ Romeo Crennel, Texans: Called 34 pass plays and handed the ball off only 14 times in a torrential downpour in 10-7 loss to the Browns.

▪ Matt Patricia, Lions: Improved to 4-5, but needed a 59-yard field goal to avoid a loss after blowing a 24-3 third-quarter lead to Washington.

▪ Brian Flores, Dolphins: The blowout win over Chargers was his team’s fifth win in a row to improve to 6-3. The Dolphins are excelling in all three phases; in their last three games, they have two defensive touchdowns, a punt-return touchdown, and a blocked punt that was recovered on the 1.

▪ Mike Vrabel, Titans: The Colts had no respect for the Titans defense, going for it five times on fourth down and converting three in their 34-17 win.

▪ Joe Judge, Giants: Probably has the best team in the NFC East after Sunday’s impressive 27-17 win against the Eagles. The Giants started 0-5 but are now 3-7, and have a legitimate shot to win the division.





Stats of the Week




▪ The top nine teams in the AFC have a 20-3 record against the NFC.

▪ Rams coach Sean McVay is 31-0 career when leading at halftime.

▪ Jaguars WR Keelan Cole became the first player with a punt-return touchdown and receiving touchdown in the same game against the Packers, who have been part of the NFL since 1921.

▪ Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is now 0-6 career when trailing by the score 20-10.

▪ The Bucs' win over the Panthers was the first 46-23 score in NFL history.

▪ The Bengals went 0 for 13 on third down, tied for the third-worst performance since the NFL began tracking third downs in 1991. The Cardinals went 0 for 15 in 2012 and the Bucs went 0 for 14 in 2009.

▪ Bucs RB Ronald Jones joined Derrick Henry, Tony Dorsett, and Ahman Green as the only players in NFL history with touchdown runs of at least 98 yards.

Alex Cora has returned to an improved scenario for the Red Sox





By Chad Finn Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 6:00 p.m.



The return of Red Sox manager Alex Cora (left) hints that he's copacetic with what chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom has in the works to escape this malaise of the past two seasons.Maddie Malhotra/Boston Red Sox





Think they’ve told Alex Cora about the state of the starting rotation yet?

The last time he was here, before his “mutual parting” and his one-year suspension for his bang-the-trash-can-slowly role in the 2017 Astros' cheating scandal, the Red Sox endured a disappointing season.

They plummeted to 84 wins, or 24 fewer than they won in 2018 when they stormed their way to their fourth World Series title this century. They missed the playoffs, and without much suspense.



That ’19 team was still rich with talent, even if most of the pitching staff underperformed and/or struggled with injuries. The Red Sox did get 113 starts out of Chris Sale, David Price, Eduardo Rodriguez, and Rick Porcello in ’19, the four starters who were the backbone of the ’18 champs.

Not one of them started a game for the Red Sox in 2020.

The longstanding prediction that Sale would someday blow out his elbow came true, 10 seasons into his superb career. Rodriguez missed the whole season with COVID-19 complications. Porcello signed with the Mets and pitched like a guy who didn’t have many options besides signing with the Mets, and Price escaped to Los Angeles in the Mookie Betts trade, then opted out of the season.

As far as sequels go, I thought that ’19 season was pretty much the real life equivalent of “Major League 2.” But then I looked up “Major League 2” on “Rotten Tomatoes,” and discovered it has a brutal 5 percent rating among critics.

So last season – when the Red Sox didn’t fall off by 24 games, but actually won just 24 games total in the most bizarre abbreviated season that we will hopefully ever witness — well, yeah, that was our “Major League 2” of a Red Sox season. Brutal.

I’m being facetious, of course. Cora knew about the pitching and everything else that has changed since he last wrote out a lineup card on Sept. 29, 2019, with Mookie Betts’s name at the top.

That he came back is foremost a sign that there wasn’t a better gig out there for him (he should have been the White Sox' choice over Tony La Russa). But it also suggests that he’s copacetic with what chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom has in the works to escape this malaise of the past two seasons.

Related: The inside story of how the Red Sox decided to rehire Alex Cora

And there’s reason to be optimistic about Bloom’s capabilities, even after all of that. [Makes sweeping gesture at the entire 2020 season.]

He’s already made clever, beneficial trades. No one has chirped more often than me about the foolishness of trading Betts, and if you’re one of those correspondents asking if I’ll ever write another Sox column again without mentioning him, the answer is yes, in 2027. I hate — that is the right word, hate — that they traded him.

But that decision most likely was made before Bloom swapped in his Rays polo shirt for a Red Sox one. And if he had to absolutely make the move, he did pretty well. Alex Verdugo is an energetic, well-rounded player who may even make a couple of All-Star teams. Jeter Downs has a terrible name, but he is promising enough that colleague Alex Speier rates him in Baseball America as the team’s No. 2 prospect. He should be the regular second baseman in a season or two and hopefully will have changed his name to Nomar Downs by then. Connor Wong could be a versatile bench option with the ability to catch. It was a trade that never should have been made, but we shouldn’t hold that against the interesting players Bloom got in return.

More encouraging are the small deals he’s already won, in less than a full year on the job. Acquiring Nick Pivetta (who has a shot at cracking the rotation after an impressive late season audition) and Connor Seabold for relievers Heath Hembree and Brandon Workman is already a win. They were a pair of disasters for the Phillies, averaging a 9.27 ERA in 25 combined appearances. Both are now free agents.

Bloom signed Kevin Pillar as a free agent and eventually dealt him for an interesting pitching prospect in Jacob Wallace, formerly of UConn. Mitch Moreland went to the Padres for pair of top-15 Red Sox prospects (per the valuable soxprospects.com) in outfielder Jeisson Rosario and corner infielder Hudson Potts.

I wonder sometimes if we give Bloom too much credit for the Rays' knack for finding overlooked talent and making savvy secondary trades, since Erik Neander was the one ultimately making the decisions. But the early signs during his Sox tenure strongly suggest Bloom has that same ability.

That bodes well for the approach to free agency as well. There is going to be an enormous pool of players to consider, from the 180-plus current free agents to the countless established players (see Brad Hand, for an early example) of players that will be non-tendered before the Dec. 2 deadline.

There is going to be a golden, and perhaps unprecedented, opportunity to add quality players at reasonable to bargain rates this winter. I’m sure Cora has some suggestions on whom he would like to acquire, perhaps starting with former Astros and Rays starter Charlie Morton.

Related: A look at the top free agents, and how they could fit with the Red Sox

Count me among those who don’t believe the Red Sox should pull a Dave Dombrowski and get heavily involved in pursuing the biggest-name free agents. National League Cy Young winner Trevor Bauer would change the entire landscape of that rotation, but his increased spin rate last season is … let’s say curious, and I suspect he’s a bauble new Mets owner Steve Cohen is going to covet. The best positional free agent is Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto, but the Red Sox would have to deal Christian Vazquez to pursue him, and that seems improbable, even if it isn’t a bad idea.

Cora is coming back to a team that features three superb talents who are thrilled he’s back (Xander Bogaerts, Rafael Devers, and I’ll include J.D. Martinez here based on what he achieved playing for Cora).

He’s coming to a team that has some promising young players that weren’t a part of this roster or were just arriving when he was last here (Verdugo, Tanner Houck, Bobby Dalbec, and Darwinzon Hernandez, another whose ’20 season was altered by the virus).

And he’s coming back to a team that is going to mine that non-tender pool and the lower tiers of free agency for help.

He has to be OK with that. There’s no Sale, at least until later in the season, no Price, and no Mookie. But it’s a much better scenario for everyone than last year, when Cora had no job, and the Red Sox had no chance.

If harassing the quarterback was a real stat, Patriots linebacker Chase Winovich would be among the leaders





By Jim McBride Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 7:18 p.m.



No epic rainstorm was going to extinguish Chase Winovich’s passion Sunday night.

The Patriots' defensive end/linebacker/philosophical savage always plays as if shock of blond locks are on fire and his relentless effort against the Ravens was his best performance as a pro.



Chase Winovich (50) is all smiles as he celebrates a fourth-quarter stop with John Simon (55).Jim Davis/Globe Staff





The official record doesn’t show any quarterback stats for Winovich: zero sacks and zero hits landed on Lamar Jackson. Harassing, however, isn’t yet an officially recognized stat by the NFL, and Winovich clearly led the effort to make the Baltimore quarterback uncomfortable in the 23-17 victory Sunday night.





Winovich was playing off the ball for the first time since his glory days playing for the Thomas Jefferson High Jaguars in Jefferson Hills, Pa., and was a one-man storm force, consistently forcing Jackson off his spot and into scramble mode. And while that’s normally not a bad thing for Jackson, it was on this soggy night, as Winovich funneled him to the arms of his teammates.

Unofficially, Winovich pressured Jackson 10 times.

"It really felt like I was playing high school football in a way and I had a blast,'' said Winovich. "I love being in a position where I can pursue and play physical, so when I am in a position like that it allows me to make the most of some of my attributes. Just being able to attack and play and come off the edge and penetrate and make fast decisions using my instincts. It was a fun experience — and dropping into coverage, that was cool, too.''

Winovich had a strong start to the season before his snaps started drying up to the point where he played just five against the Bills. His coaches insisted the reduction was game-plan related, not performance based, and expressed confidence in him.

He was back in business against the Jets, playing 31 snaps and then was omnipresent vs. the Ravens, playing 65 of a possible 66 snaps.

The game plan called for Winovich, who also drew a holding call on Ravens right tackle D.J. Fluker, to hound Jackson and also help set the edge.

Missions accomplished.

His ability and flexibility to seek and destroy and also stand tall at the point of attack allows coaches to keep him on the field in virtually every situation.

"I have always said that I am a football player just looking for opportunities to help the team win in any way possible,'' said the second-year player out of Michigan. “This was a really fun game for a lot of reasons, but getting to play off the ball again was definitely something I enjoyed since I view myself as a pretty versatile football player.

"I am just grateful to my coaches for giving me the opportunity to expand my role. Secondly, thankful for my teammates — Ja’Whaun Bentley, Terez Hall, John Simon, and specifically [outside linebackers coach] Steve Belichick, especially with the coverage stuff, just helping me get my mind oriented and get my keys right. And [inside linebackers coach] Jerod [Mayo], especially, with in-game adjustments.”

It’s always a chess match when it comes to adjustments and the Ravens are usually adept at counterattacks. On Sunday, they had no answers to keep Winovich out of Jackson’s face. He spearheaded a pass rush that had struggled this season and, as a result, caused cracks in pass coverage. Sunday, the secondary got a boost from the front seven’s pressure.

The reigning MVP acknowledged he was ticked off. Winovich? Not so much.

"I was dancing, and I was having fun,'' said Winovich, who collected seven tackles in the slop. "At first you kind of resist the rain and try to stay dry enough where you can still tackle, but after a while it is just a matter of taking the approach and mind-set where you tell yourself you want it to pour and be cold because if you have that mind-set and your opponent doesn’t, that gives you an edge. When you have that attitude, it becomes infectious to your teammates.

"Playing in the rain was fun . . . It was a great day to be a Patriot.''

. . .

Bill Belichick on Monday pointed out that the players and coaches wore helmet stickers and pins honoring the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) organization, which provides support for families and friends grieving the loss of a member of the United States armed forces. "I just want to take a moment to recognize the families and the losses that they’ve suffered and how much we appreciate the people who defend our freedom and who have given their lives as part of that defense,'' the coach said . . . Belichick noted that defensive tackle Carl Davis “has transitioned well” to New England that he’s received help from fellow DT and fellow former Raven Lawrence Guy with his acclimation. Davis was signed from the Jaguars' practice squad last month . . . Linebackers Hall and Cassh Maluia were returned to the practice squad . . . QB Jake Dolegala was re-signed to the practice squad after he was released last week for roster-maneuver purposes . . . Tight end David Wells was released from the practice squad . . . The club brought in guards Zack Bailey and Ross Reynolds, center Sam Jones, and offensive tackle Timon Parris for workouts.

Cam Newton goes inside what he told Jakobi Meyers before the Patriots' trick play vs. the Ravens





By Hayden Bird Boston.com Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 12:45 p.m.



Cam Newton celebrates in the driving rain after the Patriots beat the Ravens on Sunday night at Gillette Stadium.Elise Amendola/Associated Press





Thinking back to the Patriots’ week of practice leading up to Sunday’s upset of the Ravens, Cam Newton told “The Greg Hill Show” on Monday morning that it was another example of Bill Belichick seeing the future.

In this case, it was making players practice in difficult weather conditions.

“Coach [was] like, ‘Whatever we get out there, we’re going to practice in it,’ ” Newton recalled. “We had an opportunity to practice in some type of weather like that. I think it was beneficial for us.”



Amid heavy wind and rain Sunday night, the Patriots played largely mistake-free football while the Ravens were unable to match them.

Still, despite the ultimate outcome in a 23-17 win, Newton lamented a missed touchdown pass to wide receiver Jakobi Meyers.

“It was like throwing a medicine ball though. I knew it as soon as it left my hand,” said Newton of the missed score in the third quarter. “There were a couple of those throws as a matter of fact like that last night where it was just like, ‘God, take the ball,’ and hopefully it gets to the right place. But last night was fun. Winning is always fun.”

Now 4-5, the 2020 Patriots' best days are still ahead, according to Newton.

“I do know that we haven’t peaked as a team,” Newton asserted.

Here are a few other notable points from his interview:





Going inside the huddle before Meyers’s touchdown pass




The most dramatic play for the Patriots was a touchdown pass thrown not by Newton, but by Meyers. With just over a minute remaining in the second quarter, Meyers calmly dropped a 24-yard toss into the hands of running back Rex Burkhead to give the Patriots a lead they would not relinquish.

The second-year receiver has a history not only as a quarterback, but also with Newton (having played as a 16-year-old in the 7-on-7 All-Star tournament hosted by Newton’s foundation in North Carolina).

“Jakobi can take the humble route, but I know personally [who] Jakobi is,” said Newton in praise of his teammate. "In high school, when he was on my 7-on-7 team, Jakobi without question I would say could throw it 65-70 yards, easily. With him having a baseball background — he played baseball — it was always the short, intermediate passes that Jakobi lacked.

“So when I saw him throw yesterday, I wasn’t surprised,” Newton added. “I’ve seen him throw it a thousand times.”

Newton offered some inside access into the Patriots' huddle when the wide receiver pass play was called.

“He heard it, I was like, ‘Well, we got X, Y, Z,’ and Jakobi looked, he was like, ‘Huh?’ ” Newton explained. “I said, 'Yeah, the play was called. He looks down, he was like, ‘Damn, hold on.’ So everybody’s looking at him, looking at his gloves, so he’s like, ‘Well, I gotta take off one of these gloves.’ He took off one of his gloves. [Ryan Izzo] was like, ‘You want my warm pouch, so you can keep your hands dry?’ [Meyers] was like, ‘No, no, no, but hold my second glove, too.’ ”

“We had a moment as an offense in that huddle,” Newton added, “because it was coming off a TV timeout, and Jakobi was [nervous]. I was like, ‘Bro, relax, if you don’t got nobody, just throw it to your check-down, which is me, and I’m going to make something out of it.’ ”

Yet when the play began, Newton was unexpectedly covered. Still, Meyers saw Burkhead and was able to find him for the score.

“When the play was snapped, somebody went straight to me, so I was like, ‘Dang, Jakobi, you have nobody, so just throw it!’ ” said Newton. “And I was telling him to throw it out of bounds, but he ended up making the play. And when I looked at the play on ESPN, I was like what is [the defender] doing? He’s trying to keep his hands over [Burkhead’s] eyes? But it was just fun, and making those plays is something that we’re going to need moving forward a lot, especially getting into the second half of the season.”





An update on Julian Edelman




The Patriots have managed to win back-to-back games without the help of wide receiver Julian Edelman, who was placed on injured reserve in October after having a procedure on his knee.

Edelman, 34, is eligible to return in Week 11 against the Texans, and is reportedly progressing toward a return to the field. Newton was asked about Edelman on Monday.

“I can confirm he’s getting better, he’s getting well,” Newton said of the Patriots' veteran receiver.

Newton added some perspective on what he thinks Edelman’s place is in team history.

“Julian Edelman is obviously a pinnacle, I would say a person that’s on Mount Rushmore of Patriots history over the years for everything that he has done and what he represents as a player, so I’m just anticipating the day that he comes back.”

Patriots fans are ‘second to none’




After explaining earlier in the season his disappointment at not being able to play in front of Patriots fans, Newton was asked if playing in a prime-time matchup gave the team extra momentum even in an empty Gillette Stadium.

The Patriots' quarterback said that “every game” feels like a prime-time matchup because of the fanbase as a whole.

“Especially being here in Boston,” Newton noted. “The fan support is like second to none. Not to say where I was before it wasn’t good, because it was. But at the same time, you just try to find any type of competitive nature to get yourself going. And it is tough sometimes not to have a crowd, because that momentum is just stale. You have to generate the momentum on the sideline with the army that you brought. For us, we’ve been able to generate that enough here in the last couple weeks.”

Saints QB Drew Brees suffered broken ribs, collapsed lung





By Staff and wire reportsUpdated November 16, 2020, 5:19 p.m.



Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) returned for a touchdown drive in the final two minutes of the half, despite having already suffered rib injuries and a collapsed lung.Brett Duke/Associated Press





Drew Brees has been diagnosed with multiple rib fractures and a collapsed right lung, a person with knowledge of the situation said Monday.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the Saints have not announced specifics about Brees’s injury, which the 41-year-old quarterback said occurred on a heavy hit by San Francisco defensive lineman Kentavius Street in the second quarter of New Orleans’s 27-13 victory Sunday.

Brees’s injuries are expected to sideline the quarterback for multiple weeks. Two of the Saints' next three games are against the Falcons, first on Sunday in the Superdome and then in Atlanta on Dec. 6. In between, New Orleans visits Denver on Nov. 29.



With Brees virtually certain to miss upcoming games, the Saints' offense is likely to be run primarily by Jameis Winston, the 2015 first overall draft choice by Tampa Bay whom New Orleans signed this offseason. Taysom Hill, a utility player who intermittently takes over for Brees on option plays — but also plays tight end and on special teams — also could see his snaps at quarterback increase.

While Brees initially missed just two plays after the hit by Street and returned for another touchdown drive in the final two minutes of the half, he told coach Sean Payton he did not feel fit to continue in the second half Sunday. Winston took most of the snaps after that, with Hill also running a number of plays behind center.

Winston was a starter for most of five seasons in Tampa Bay, but became a free agent after former Patriots QB Tom Brady agreed to join the Buccaneers.





Giants' Baker cleared; attorney charged with extortion




Former New York Giants cornerback DeAndre Baker was cleared of robbery charges in Florida after his alleged victims' attorney was arrested on extortion charges.

The Broward County State Attorney’s Office announced it was dropping all charges against Baker shortly after the county sheriff’s office arrested attorney William Dean, 50, and charged him with extortion.

Baker, 23, had been charged with holding up four men at gunpoint at a May barbecue in suburban Fort Lauderdale. Seahawks cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who had originally been accused of assisting Baker, had previously been cleared for lack of evidence.

The sheriff’s office says Dean told Baker’s attorney, Bradford Cohen, that the three alleged victims he represented would stop cooperating with prosecutors or change their stories if they were paid $266,000 each. Investigators say Dean said his clients would “do anything you want, so long as the money is right.”

Prosecutor Paul R. Valcore said in a statement that the alleged victims' credibility “is unalterably tarnished,” making the prosecution of Baker impossible. If convicted, Baker faced a minimum of 10 years in prison and could have received life.

Dean was being held Monday pending an initial court hearing.

Baker was a first-round pick for the Giants in the 2019 NFL draft out of Georgia. He played in all 16 games last season, and was expected to be a starter this year before his arrest.

The NFL placed him on the exempt list in July and he was released by the Giants in September.





Denver’s Lock ailing




Vic Fangio is adamant about Drew Lock playing through his growing pains — bruised ribs willing.

While reiterating that he’s not about to bench his struggling second-year quarterback, Fangio said Lock might miss Wednesday’s practice and that his availability also is uncertain for Sunday when the Broncos (3-6) host the Dolphins (6-3).

“Like with many injuries, the next day is worse than the actual injury during the competition, so he’s pretty sore today with the ribs and we’ll see where he’s at on Wednesday,” Fangio said.

The more practice snaps he misses the greater the chances that backup Brett Rypien will get his second career start.

“We definitely want Drew to have a good week of preparation so that he’s ready to play the game,” Fangio said. “So, that could enter into the equation as we go through the week.”

Lock, who threw four interceptions in Denver’s 37-12 loss at Las Vegas on Sunday, grimaced in pain for much of the afternoon after a blindside tackle by Arden Key in the second quarter. Afterward, he dismissed questions about being hurt, saying, “I’m fine, I’ll be good.”





Browns forced to shut down facility again




Browns fullback Andy Janovich was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list after Cleveland shut down its facility for the second time in four days due to another positive test. Janovich played in Sunday’s home win over the Texans. He joins offensive lineman Chris Hubbard on the COVID list, which was created for players who test positive or have been quarantined after close contact with an infected person. Hubbard tested positive Friday, and had to sit out against the Texans . . . The 49ers placed defensive lineman Arik Armstead on the COVID-19 list. The 49ers are on a bye this week and don’t play again until Nov. 29 against the Rams, so it’s unclear if Armstead will miss any time . . . The Titans placed linebacker David Long on the reserve/COVID-19 list, but the team facility remained open based on the results of contact tracing. Tennessee had the weekend off after losing 34-17 to Indianapolis on Nov. 12 . . . Washington is joining Baltimore and Philadelphia in not having fans at its next game, Sunday against Cincinnati. The team says in a statement it has been monitoring the virus situation with local and Maryland state authorities and “take the responsibility of protecting our staff, players, fans. and the community seriously and feel this is the right decision at this time.” Washington, which plays its home games in Landover, Md., allowed 3,000 fans for its last home game . . . Dallas quarterback Andy Dalton has been cleared for practice after getting through the protocols for a concussion and COVID-19. Coach Mike McCarthy said Dalton participated in an informal practice Monday, the first day back for the Cowboys coming off their open week. Dallas (2-7) visits Minnesota on Sunday. Dalton got a concussion Oct. 25 at Washington on a hit that led to the ejection of linebacker Jon Bostic. Dalton was expected to be cleared from that when the 10th-year player was placed on the COVID-19 reserve list Nov. 2 . . . The Chiefs signed Andy Reid and Brett Veach to contract extensions that will provide added stability by keeping together the most successful coach/general manager combination in franchise history well into the future. The Chiefs declined to announce the terms of the extensions, though it’s unlikely the 62-year-old Reid or the 42-year-old Veach was going anywhere. They have built a juggernaut, reaching back-to-back AFC Championship games and delivering the Chiefs their first Super Bowl title in 50 years last season. And at 8-1, they are in good position to defend the title. Reid, who recently passed Curly Lambeau for fifth on the NFL wins list with 230, is in the midst of his eighth season in Kansas City after a long tenure in Philadelphia. He took over a team that was 2-14 upon his arrival and built a consistent winner, one that has reached new heights under Super Bowl MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

How did NBC find footage of Jakobi Meyers throwing TD passes in high school so fast?





By Chad Finn Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 1:29 p.m.



Jakobi Meyers celebrates his touchdown pass with Damiere Byrd (right) on Sunday.Jim Davis/Globe Staff





The result — a 24-yard touchdown pass to Rex Burkhead — would suggest the Ravens weren’t prepared for Patriots receiver Jakobi Meyers to throw the football Sunday night.

But NBC’s “Sunday Night Football” production team was beyond prepared, even firing up highlights of Meyers as a dart-throwing high school quarterback in Georgia just a kickoff and a commercial break after his surprise pass with a little over a minute remaining in the first half.

The question showed up in my feed on Twitter almost as soon as the ball settled into Burkhead’s hands: “Meyers had zero career pass attempts. How did NBC have those high school quarterback highlights ready to go after the commercial break?”



As it turned out, it wasn’t a case of Bill Belichick or Josh McDaniels tipping off broadcasters Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, and Michele Tafoya about some planned trickery.

Related: Chad Finn: The Patriots' win over the Ravens proves nothing is out of reach, and other thoughts

Instead, as “Sunday Night Football” executive producer Fred Gaudelli explained in a message via NBC Sports after the game, it came from familiarity with the Patriots and his production team’s weekly quest to be ready for anything.

“We knew Jakobi was a high school quarterback from when he was a rookie free agent last year and we had the Patriots in Week 1,” said Gaudelli, whose Sunday night crew has broadcast 36 regular-season Patriots games since 2006, as well as postseason matchups that include the Super Bowl win over the Seahawks and losses to the Giants and Eagles.

"This season, I read quotes from Cam Newton talking about how cerebral a wide receiver Jakobi was because he had previously played quarterback. We decided to get footage of his high school highlights in case he was called to throw a pass.

“In every Patriots game we do, someone other than a quarterback seems to throw a pass — Julian Edelman vs. the Ravens in the 2014 playoffs [Jan. 10, 2015], Edelman on the opening Sunday night last year, etc. We were covering our bases in the eventuality that it happened again.”





It did happen again, and the broadcast team was so ready that Michaels mentioned Meyers was a high school quarterback before the ball settled into Burkhead’s hands.

After the extra-point attempt and a commercial break, Michaels introduced the highlights of Meyers’s quarterbacking days at Arabia Mountain High School in Georgia, featuring footage of him lofting two impressive deep completions and another laser throw for a touchdown.

Pretty impressive stuff on the preparation that goes into being ready for just about anything.



WR Jakobi Meyers threw an absolute dime last night for the @Patriots on SNF.

Boston College football team gets well-deserved break – and then some





By Julian Benbow Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 7:21 p.m.



After nine consecutive games, BC quarterback Phil Jurkovec will have the next two weeks off to rest up his arm for the finish of the 2020 season in December.Michael Dwyer/Associated Press





Text messages flooded the phone of Boston College first-year head coach Jeff Hafley not long after the Eagles' 45-31 loss last Saturday to No. 2 Notre Dame.

He got words of encouragement from football alums such as Doug Flutie and Matt Ryan. He also received kind words from Celtics coach Brad Stevens.

“That one kind of surprised me,” Hafley said. “But just little things like that mean a lot to me and it shows what the city of Boston has seen and they can count on me getting this thing going.”



The Eagles faced the Irish just two weeks after taking on the then-top-ranked Clemson Tigers and even though the Fighting Irish were a completely different animal from a Clemson team that was missing star quarterback Trevor Lawrence, BC showed it could compete with the country’s college powerhouses.

More than anything else, the most important takeaway from the Notre Dame loss for Hafley was how much his team needed rest. The Eagles played nine straight games before getting this week off to catch their breath. The only team in the country that’s played more games is Texas State.

“I’m going to go take a nap for the first time in a long time,” Hafley said.





The Eagles non-stop schedule was a byproduct of some rearranging as college football scrambled to return amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, the Eagles were supposed to open the season against Ohio, get a week off, then face Duke.

But when the Mid-American Conference announced it was canceling fall sports, Ohio was dropped from the schedule, the Eagles opened against Duke, and their open week in September was filled with a game against Texas State.

This week’s bye feels long overdue.

“I think the team probably needs it more than me,” Hafley said. “Just because physically they’re playing. I think, mentally, I think the staff and I all need to just get away for a day — or a day and a half or two — Just to kind of hit the reset button a little bit because we haven’t had a day off really, since we’ve been back in July, which is fair, it’s what football coaches do.

“But usually you have a bye week somewhere earlier than it is now. And you need to be fresh because you coach better when you’re fresh, you treat people better when you’re fresh,” Hafley added. “And sometimes it’s hard because we just go on adrenaline, and you kind of see me from my first Zoom into this one, and I look like a ghost. I look awful.

“So hopefully I’ll have some more sunshine in my face. When I come back.”

An unpredictable season added one more wrinkle on Monday when the Atlantic Coast Conference announced a series of schedule changes in the wake of a COVID-19 outbreak within the Miami football program.

Thirteen players were unavailable for the Hurricanes win over Virginia Tech last week and 11 were missing the week before against N.C. State. The Hurricanes will quarantine for two weeks before resuming on Dec. 5 against Wake Forest.

Miami’s matchup set up for Saturday against Georgia Tech was moved to Dec. 19 and will only be played if Miami is not in the ACC championship game.

As a result, BC will actually get the rest it has been looking for.

Coming out of the bye week, the Eagles were supposed to face Louisville on Nov. 27. Instead, the ACC pushed that game to Dec. 12, leaving the Eagles with two weeks between their next game at Virginia on Dec. 5.

“I cannot wait to get back on the practice field after we all catch our breath a little bit,” Hafley said. “Which is a well-deserved break for a team that’s played nine straight games, been here since June and hasn’t had a positive COVID test. It’s remarkable. And it’s going to be a year I probably look back on and say, ‘Man, that was a pretty impressive 2020 team and staff.’”

Nick Foles injured late as Vikings finally deliver a Monday Night Football win for Kirk Cousins





By ANDREW SELIGMAN The Associated Press,Updated November 16, 2020, 11:52 p.m.

CHICAGO — Kirk Cousins threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns, and the Minnesota Vikings overcame a 104-yard kickoff return by Chicago’s Cordarrelle Patterson to beat the Bears, 19-13, on Monday night.

Cousins won for the first time in 10 career Monday night starts. He hit Adam Thielen with a 6-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to put Minnesota ahead, 19-13, and the Vikings (4-5) hung on for their third straight win. They also snapped a four-game losing streak against Chicago (5-5).

Bears quarterback Nick Foles got taken from the field on a cart in the game’s final minute. He landed on his right, throwing shoulder when he was slammed to the ground by Minnesota’s Ifeadi Odenigbo as he threw the ball away.





Patterson joined Josh Cribbs and Leon Washington as the only players with eight kick returns for touchdowns when he ran back the opening kickoff of the second half to give Chicago a 13-7 lead. It was the longest kickoff return in franchise history, surpassing Gale Sayers’ 103-yarder against Pittsburgh on Sept. 17, 1967.

Still, the Bears lost their fourth in a row, matching their longest skid since coach Matt Nagy was hired in 2018.

Cousins completed 25 of 36 passes. He threw two touchdowns to Thielen, who made a one-handed grab on a first-quarter score.

Minnesota's Dalvin Cook ran for 96 yards on 30 attempts, and Justin Jefferson caught eight passes for 135 yards. The defense did not allow an offensive touchdown for the first time in 20 games, including the playoffs, and the Vikings won for just the fourth time in 18 games at Soldier Field since it reopened in 2003 following renovations.

With offensive coordinator Bill Lazor calling the plays after Nagy handed off those duties in an effort to lift a unit that ranks near the bottom of the NFL, the Bears managed 149 yards. It was their lowest total since they had 147 against San Francisco on Dec. 3, 2017.

Foles threw for 106 yards and an interception. It was a far cry from his previous start against the Vikings, when he led Philadelphia past them in the NFC championship game on the way to a Super Bowl title in 2018.

Khalil Mack had his first interception since 2018. But the Bears continued to fade after a 5-1 start.

The Bears led, 13-7, when Chicago’s Dwayne Harris muffed a punt. The Vikings' Josh Metellus recovered at the 20, leading to Dan Bailey’s 37-yard field goal. Bailey added a tying 43-yarder with just under two minutes left in the third.

Chris Paul sent from Thunder to the Suns for 4 players and a first-round pick





Updated November 16, 2020, 6:09 p.m.



Ten-time All-Star Chris Paul is on the move according to a report, going from Oklahoma City to Houston.Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press





Chris Paul holds a $44 million option for the 2021-22 season, a massive payday that may have kept some teams from trying to trade for the All-Star point guard. The Phoenix Suns weren’t deterred.

They have a pair of All-Stars in their backcourt now, with hopes the duo of Paul and Devin Booker — one of the league’s most dynamic young scorers — will be enough to get the franchise back to the postseason for the first time since 2010.

The trade sending Paul to the Suns from Oklahoma City was completed Monday night, a blockbuster to start what could be a wild few days of NBA transactions before training camps begin next month.



The particulars: The Suns get Paul and forward Abdel Nader, while the Thunder get Kelly Oubre Jr., Ricky Rubio, Ty Jerome, Jalen Lecque, and a protected 2022 first-round pick.

“We are excited to welcome Chris Paul and Abdel Nader to Phoenix,” Suns general manager James Jones said. "Chris’s leadership and competitive approach to the game will have an immeasurable impact on our team. Abdel possesses all the traits on and off the court that will complement our culture.”





Porzingis to miss start of season




Kristaps Porzingis will miss the start of the season as the Dallas Mavericks star continues recovery from October surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. President of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said in a radio interview Monday the club was being cautious with Luka Doncic’s European sidekick, who missed more than a season because of another knee injury earlier in his career. Porzingis injured his right knee in the opener of a first-round series against the Los Angeles Clippers in the bubble in August. Porzingis averaged 20.4 points and 9.5 rebounds in his first season with Dallas.

… The Detroit Pistons agreed to trade Bruce Brown to the Brooklyn Nets for Dzanan Musa and a 2021 second-round draft pick, according to a person familiar with the deal. The 6-foot-4-inch Brown, drafted in the second round in 2018, averaged 8.9 points per game this past season for Detroit. The 6-9 Musa was a first-round pick in 2018. He averaged 4.8 points in 40 games last season.





Jury can decide Oakley lawsuit




A jury can decide whether former New York Knicks star Charles Oakley was ejected from Madison Square Garden with excessive force when he was removed as a spectator to a 2017 game, an appeals court in New York ruled Monday The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated assault and battery claims Oakley made in a lawsuit brought against the team’s owners after his February 2017 removal from a game the Knicks lost to the Los Angeles Clippers. A three-judge panel concluded a jury could decide whether it was improper for security guards to throw Oakley to the ground after Oakley, according to his court papers, slapped their hands away in self-defense as he sought to watch the game. The appeals court, though, rejected Oakley’s claims of defamation and false imprisonment … New Los Angeles Clippers coach Tyronn Lue has finalized his staff. Dan Craig was hired as associate head coach, along with assistants Kenny Atkinson, Chauncey Billups, Larry Drew, and Roy Rogers.

Nicholas Gioacchini and Sebastian Soto both scored their first two international goals, Gio Reyna got his first and a young United States team routed Panama, 6-2, Monday night in an exhibition at Wiener Neustadt, Austria. Gioacchini and Reyna made their first appearances Thursday in a 0-0 draw at Wales, among six debuts as the Americans returned from a coronavirus break that had sidelined the team since February. Soto and Richy Ledezma were among two more debuts against the Panamanians. Sebastian Lletget, like Soto a second-half substitute, also scored late for the Americans. Ledezma assisted on the final goal. Preparing for the pandemic-delayed start of World Cup qualifying next September, the US started a lineup averaging 12 appearances and 22 years, 154 days, the second-youngest American lineup behind an average of 22 years, 71 days for an exhibition at Italy on Nov. 20, 2018. US coach Gregg Berhalter said the US may schedule another match next month, which presumably would be with players mostly from Major League Soccer.





EPL has 16 positive cases





Sixteen people tested positive for the coronavirus and placed in a 10-day quarantine in the latest round of checks on players and club staff in the English Premier League, in which tested 1,207 players and club staff were tested from Nov 9-15. It is the highest number of positive tests recorded in a single week since testing began ahead of the return of football in June after the sport’s suspension amid the pandemic . . . Luis Suárez and goalkeeper Rodrigo Muñoz tested positive for the coronavirus, the Uruguayan Football Association said. The two players along with a team staffer were infected and will miss Uruguay’s home match against Brazil on Tuesday in South American World Cup qualifying . . . Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney completed a $2.5 million takeover of the Welsh club Wexham, one of the world’s oldest soccer teams that plays in the fifth tier of the English game, and plan to document their first foray into the sport in a fly-on-the-wall TV show.





Hockey





Lightning layoff 30 employees




Just months after winning the Stanley Cup, the Tampa Bay Lightning are eliminating 30 positions in a sign that even winning a championship does not spare a team from the effects of the coronavirus. Because the National Hockey League’s postseason was played in bubbles in Canada, the team did not earn any revenue from the playoffs. The Lightning lost money last season and is expected to do so again during the upcoming season, team officials said. The positions were across the company and effective immediately and represented less than 10 percent of the team’s workforce. “Rest assured, these decisions were not made lightly,” Lightning CEO Steve Griggs told the Tampa Bay Times. “But with the sports and entertainment industry being impacted like at no other time in modern history, this was a necessary step as we position ourselves for maximum recovery.” Every employee who was working full-time in late September when the Lightning defeated the Dallas Stars to win the Stanley Cup will receive a championship ring, the newspaper reported . . . The Buffalo Sabres signed their first-round draft pick, forward Jack Quinn, to a three-year entry-level contract. Quinn, 19, was selected with the No. 8 pick in the draft last month after ranking second in the Ontario Hockey League with 52 goals in 62 games.

The Patriots' win over the Ravens proves nothing is out of reach, and other thoughts





By Chad Finn Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 9:31 a.m.



Cam Newton and the Patriots offered up the type of inspiring performance that didn't seem possible this season.Jim Davis/Globe Staff





Sixteen thoughts on the Patriots' 23-17 win over the Ravens …

1. Some of us (ahem) needed the lesson more than others, but make no mistake, the lesson has been learned. Even when the Patriots' opponent looks superior on paper and in the standings, even when it feels like the season has taken an irreparable turn for the worse and the good times will be few, writing off Bill Belichick’s team against any opponent is a formal request to look like a fool.

The Patriots came into Sunday’s night’s matchup with a 3-5 record, one win (against the Jets, who I believe were informally relegated from the NFL in 1989) in their last five games, and facing a frequent nemesis that last season had sent the franchise into the kind of rut it hadn’t endured in 20 years. It looked as bleak as the rainy, windy Foxborough weather, which looked like an outtake from “The Perfect Storm.”



2. So what happened? Just the kind of inspiring teamwide feat we’ve seen so many times the past two decades, but the kind thing that seemed out of reach this season.

The Patriots went out and played tougher than the Ravens, running the ball down their gullets with second-year back (and budding sensation) Damien Harris gaining 121 often-ferocious yards on 22 carries. Cam Newton ran for a touchdown and threw for another, and the defense brutally belted the Ravens at any and every opportunity.

I don’t know if the 4-5 Patriots are a playoff team. I don’t know if what they did is sustainable. But they were the better team Sunday, and now we know what all those close early losses couldn’t confirm: They can beat anyone. They might not always do it. But they can. They can.

Related: Instant analysis: The Patriots' win over the Ravens shows what weeks of building momentum looks like

3. By the end of the game, the NBC broadcast looked like a combo of the foggy Bears-Eagles playoff game in ’87 and “Waterworld.”

This confirmed something else: The Patriots remain a terrific lousy-weather team. They did not make the fundamental mistakes that the Ravens did in the rain. Baltimore had at least three bad snaps, and two — one in a wildcat formation to Mark Ingram that killed a drive, and another later that got by Lamar Jackson — were extremely costly.

The game ended on a dropped pass by the Ravens, which was fitting. Meanwhile, Newton and the Patriots did not commit a turnover.

4. Harris was the No. 1 star of the game, setting the tone with his hard running against a defense that stacked the box and may or may not have had Ray Lewis out there in Patrick Queen’s jersey. But there were plenty of unsung heroes that deserve to be sung.

Many of Harris’s best runs seemed to come behind Isaiah Wynn and Joe Thuney on the left side, but the entire line set the tone against a team that entered with the league’s No. 1-ranked run defense.

Jakobi Meyers, whom we should believe in now, had a huge third-and-3 conversion late and threw a touchdown pass. And Rex Burkhead just chugs along as a steady contributor, with 66 total yards and a pair of receiving touchdowns.

Related: Patriots running back Damien Harris goes for a career-high 121 yards vs. the Ravens

5. Defensively, Chase Winovich was out of the doghouse and all over the field, with seven tackles and several pressures. J.C. Jackson locked down Marquise Brown — there’s a “Say Goodbye to Hollywood” joke here somewhere — and picked off a pass for the fifth straight game. Rookie Kyle Dugger had 12 tackles and, by my accounting, forced a turnover that wasn’t called (more on that in a second).

And don’t forget Jake Bailey, who punted twice in the final eight minutes: a 52-yarder to the Ravens' 20, and a 40-yarder to their 17 with 65 seconds left.

6. I’m not sure I’ve seen the Patriots offense put together a more impressive drive than its first of the second half. The Patriots went 75 yards on four plays, in this order: Harris behind left guard for 16 yards; Harris up the middle for 25 yards; Newton to Meyers for 26 yards (plus 4 yards for an unnecessary roughness penalty); and Newton behind right guard and tackle for a 4-yard touchdown run and a 20-10 lead.

Big plays have been tough to come by at times this season, which is why it was so impressive to see them blast their way down the field.

7. Jackson led the Ravens on an impressive 11-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to cut the Patriots' lead to 23-17 in the final minutes of the third quarter . . . or, I should say, it was impressive if you thought it should have been allowed to continue after the seventh play of the drive.

That was when, on third and 9, Jackson found Mark Andrews for an 8-yard gain that upon further review looked like Dugger ripped the football loose. Andrews was ruled down, and NBC officials expert Terry McAulay agreed with the decision, as former officials are wont to do when something isn’t painfully obvious, but it sure looked to these ancient eyes like the ball was hanging off of Andrews’s arm when Dugger took it.

8. I’ve been wondering when Josh McDaniels might take page out of the Trickeration Handbook and have former college quarterback Meyers unleash a pass on an unsuspecting defense.

But then, I wondered when the Patriots offensive coordinator was going to let Mohamed Sanu (who has thrown four touchdown passes on eight career attempts) a chance to throw last year and it never happened, so I can’t say I expected Meyers to get his chance Sunday night.

9. But he did, and did he ever make the most of it, lofting a perfectly placed touch pass to Rex Burkhead in the end zone for a 24-yard touchdown and a 13-10 lead with just over a minute left in the half.

Meyers is the Patriots' No. 1 receiver right now, but as far as I’m concerned, the throw should vault Meyers to No. 2 on the quarterback depth chart.





10. The Jakobi Meyers, High School Quarterback stuff did get to be a little much on the NBC broadcast, though I give them credit for their usual excellent preparation in having high school footage of him throwing the ball at the ready.

After Meyers got the perfect spot to catch a Newton dart and convert and important third down in the fourth quarter, Cris Collinsworth cited that savvy wide receiver play as something stemming from his QB days. He was awfully close to talking about Meyers as if he were some combination of Doug Flutie, Cam Newton, and Roger Staubach in college.

11. For those of us yelping the last few weeks that the hard-running Harris needs more touches, the Patriots' first series was a welcome appeasement. Harris carried on the first five plays from scrimmage, picking up 21 yards, as the Patriots charged into Ravens territory with runs on seven of their first eight plays.

12. Harris went over 100 yards early in the third quarter, and now has three 100-yard rushing games this season. I’m not as anti-Sony Michel as most (those six TDs he scored in the 2018 postseason do count) but with Harris running like this and Burkhead doing his thing, it’s hard to see what his role is when he returns.

13. That first drive actually sputtered when the Patriots got away from the run. After Newton converted a fourth-and-1 with a blast into the line, he threw an incompletion on first down, found Burkhead for 4 yards on second, and then took a costly sack on third down when Matt Judon blew past right tackled Michael Onwenu, taking the Patriots out of field goal range.

Those kind of mistakes — including Nick Folk’s missed extra point on the second touchdown — didn’t haunt on this night, though. The Patriots wouldn’t let them.

14. It took a series for Jackson and the Ravens offense to activate. But they came out full throttle on their second series, breaking off plays of 21, 19, and 13 yards on a 13-play, 94-yard drive that ended with Willie Snead IV taking a forward toss from Jackson, willing himself invisible just as Jonathan Jones was about to hit him, and scoring from 6 yards out for a 7-0.

Looked like it might be a long night for the Patriots at that point, but the Ravens couldn’t find that gear often in the rain.

15. The Patriots scored a first-quarter touchdown for the second straight week, and in impressive fashion, with Newton leading them on a seven-play, 75-yard drive on their second possession that culminated with a 4-yard catch-and-run by Burkhead to tie it at 7.

Burkhead was freed up by a mean pick behind the line scrimmage set by N’Keal Harry, who is apparently now the Kendrick Perkins of the Patriots offense.

16. I respect the attempt at shade, but it is always somewhat weird to me when a team lets a marginal player be the coin-toss captain against the team he used to play for.

The Ravens did this with Jordan Richards, a 2015 second-round pick of the Patriots whose prime contribution in 41 games over three seasons was reminding us that Belichick has a lousy track record of picking defensive backs in the second round.

Was Richards supposed to be vengeful or something? Maybe he just wanted to say hi to Patriots captain Matthew Slater?

A love letter to Gillian Anderson, continued


Also: Will there be more ‘Flesh and Blood’?


By Matthew Gilbert Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:40 p.m.



Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson in "The Fall."Steffan Hill/BBC





Q. I liked “The X-Files” as much as the next guy, but your obsession with Gillian Anderson is hard for me to understand. She was good, but you opened your review of “The Crown” with a love letter to her that I don’t think is deserved.

OVERRATED

A. No. No, no, no. Here’s the thing. “X-Files” Gillian is totally not the Gillian I’m crazy about. She had a certain cool mystique back then (let’s pretend the recent series revival never happened, shall we?), and I liked her understated work OK. But the Gillian that has emerged over the years since then has consistently impressed me.



The first time I realized that she had a lot more potential than she was able to prove within the formula of a network series was her turn as the tragic Lily Bart in the 2000 movie “The House of Mirth.” She was quietly devastating, the perfect doomed Edith Wharton heroine. And since then, I have been repeatedly dazzled. In 2005, she popped up in PBS’s excellent adaptation of “Bleak House,” playing Lady Dedlock, a woman trapped by her past. Anderson suffered magnificently, frozen faced at her window, all while pronouncing Lady Dedlock’s lines with slow, weighty sighs. She casts a compelling air of tragedy and regret over the entire production.

Next: Netflix’s “The Fall,” the British series in which she plays a relentless investigator on the trail of a serial killer. Her Stella Gibson is fine-tuned to pick up sexism and misogyny among her male colleagues, and steely when necessary. But Anderson instills her with great charisma and, if you watch her closely, which you will do every time she is on screen, you can detect clues to her true feelings. She is a dramatic heavyweight here, while, in Netflix’s “Sex Education,” she provides some of the show’s comic relief with her expert timing. She plays an enlightened sex therapist who may not quite understand her own commitment issues.

Add in her brilliance as Margaret Thatcher in “The Crown,” her enigmatic work on “Hannibal,” and her bit as Wallis Simpson on “Any Human Heart,” and you’ve got a seriously notable body of work.

MATTHEW GILBERT

Q. I watched “Flesh and Blood” on PBS’s “Masterpiece,” and I was surprised it ended without resolution. Will it be back for another season? I hope so.

CLIFFHANGER FOREVER?

A. Yeah, this is the second time recently that “Masterpiece” has aired the first season of a British series whose future is up in the air (which is a softer way of saying “unlikely”). It’s veddy, veddy annoying. Fans of “Sanditon,” too, have been lobbying for a second season of the loose Jane Austen “Masterpiece” adaptation, hoping to get their happy-ever-after despite the ongoing lack of official word.

“Flesh and Blood,” with Francesca Annis, Russell Tovey, Imelda Staunton, and Stephen Rea, has also not been officially renewed, even though it ended with a number of strings dangling. You know, nearly dead character in hospital bed suddenly opens his or her eyes. … In September, Tovey told a British publication, “I’m hoping something is on the cards for ‘Flesh and Blood’ next year, but there’s nothing official. It’s about availability. Imelda [Staunton] is playing The Queen in ‘The Crown,’ so that’s a bit of a problem! But I’d love to do more!”

A new ‘Buy Me, Boston’ is filled with more flashbacks and rare finds





By James Sullivan Globe correspondent,Updated November 16, 2020, 3:25 p.m.



Store 54 ad from The Noise, 1985.David Bieber Archives





There’s no rhyme or reason to the layout of “Buy Me, Boston, Volume 2.” The book is a sequel to Brian Coleman’s compendium of ephemera from the city’s scruffy heyday — roughly speaking, from the arrival of the weekly Boston After Dark (1966) to the early years of WFNX (which launched in 1983).

One page unearths a handmade flier for DMZ and the Ramones at the Rat; the next features an old Globe ad for an in-store appearance by Tom Heinsohn, then coaching the Celtics, at Caldor in Framingham.



A page from New England Teen Scene, January/February 1967.Courtesy of Erik Lindgren





The lack of organization, says Coleman — a tireless promoter of underground culture and the author of three books on classic hip-hop albums — is very much by design. Instead of putting, say, all the old drag-show ads in one section and the arthouse movie listings in another, they’re all jammed together like the riders on a late-arriving Orange Line train circa 1979.

The idea, Coleman says, is that a reader “would not know what’s on the next page, so they’ll keep going — like a bag of chips, where you keep going until you’re like, ‘Oh my God, I ate the whole thing.’ ”

Whether you’re old enough to remember the Unicorn Coffee House on Boylston Street or too young to remember anything on the block before the Apple store opened, “Buy Me, Boston” is a wonderland of local flashbacks. The idea, Coleman says, could be replicated easily in any city with plenty of stories to tell and enough devoted denizens to tell them.

Coleman sourced most of his material from some of Boston’s most chronic collectors, including David Bieber, who has an enormous archive of memorabilia from his career in the promotions departments at WBCN and the Phoenix; Kay Bourne, whose archives from her decades-long career at the Bay State Banner now reside at Emerson College; and Wayne Valdez, who ran Allston’s beloved Store 54 until 2016. For the second volume, Coleman scanned old keepsakes from new collaborators including local legend Willie “Loco” Alexander, longtime Boston Rock editor Tristram Lozaw, Arf! Arf! Records founder Erik Lindgren, and jazz historian Richard Vacca.

Publishing Volume 1 provided “proof of concept,” Coleman says, giving him a tangible answer to a reasonable question: “Who is this weird guy I just met who wants to borrow all my stuff?” By now he has more than 4,000 digital scans of paper curios saved up for a potential Volume 3 and beyond. In early December, he’ll host two days of events at the Dorchester Art Project to celebrate the release of Volume 2.

The books, he says, are “basically a mirror. It’s not my job to tell you what your memories are of Brigham’s or the No Name,” the 100-year-old Fish Pier restaurant that closed a year ago.

Instead, it’s his self-appointed task to uncover those memories from the rubble of the city’s not-so-distant past, and sell them back to you if you’re in the market.

“Buy Me, Boston Volume 2” is available at www.goodroadgoods.com.

From Wessie to Nessie: This Portland museum offers a crash course on cryptids





By Diane Bair and Pamela Wright Globe Correspondent,Updated November 16, 2020, 5:02 p.m.



Your walk in the Maine woods just got a lot more interesting. That crackling noise coming from behind you on the trail — is it a squirrel, or could it be a giant white “Spectre Moose,” a “cryptid canine,” or a giant snake? “People don’t often think about how many ‘monsters' exist in their nearby woods,” says cryptozoologist Loren Coleman, founder of the International Cryptozoology Museum.

Well, you will after you visit this small museum on Thompson’s Point.

This zone along Portland’s Fore River has long been a rail yard-slash-industrial site. Now, it’s home to a brewery, a distillery, a splashy new children’s museum, and theater (set to open this spring) — and the newly expanded International Cryptozoology Museum, an intriguing hodge-podge of all things cryptid.

A cryptid is a creature that’s out of place, known in the trade as an OOPA (out-of-place animal), say, a gorilla roaming Harvard Yard. Or it can be a species that is not accepted by science, like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. This includes unknown, unverified, and undiscovered species that we’re aware of through sightings, folklore, and indigenous art, plus newly discovered species, says Coleman, who’s written and coauthored more than 40 books on the subject. The field of study also encompasses sightings of animals thought to be extinct, or rare animals, such as the black tiger recently caught on camera in India, thought to be one of only six in existence.

The museum has evolved from Coleman’s home, to the back of a bookstore, and finally to this site in 2016. The two-level space holds 20,000 exhibits and objects — including traveling exhibits like “Bigfoot Revealed,” currently on display. It recently added more space and doubled in size, but the museum is still compact and twisty, enhancing its cabinet-of-curiosities feel. Additional signage would help clarify connections between, say, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the giant plaster-cast footprints, and a mounted trout covered in fluffy white fur (labeled “very rare”). They’re working on that, but for now, you make your own connections as you wander, single file, through the museum.

Big cats and mystery moose

Don’t miss the map of Maine, dotted with pins that represent sightings of cryptids in the state. Green pins represent Wendigo/Bigfoot/Sasquatch-related reports, while Sea Monsters/Sea Serpents, and Lake Monsters are marked with blue pins, and so on. There are a lot of pins in that map, especially yellow ones, representing “mystery cats.” You’re much more likely to see a big cat than Bigfoot in the Pine Tree State, Coleman says. Among the cryptid cats seen in the Northeast, 40 percent are reported to be melanistic, or black cats, he notes. There have even been sightings of giant white moose — something that would excite the most jaded vacationer.

Moving along, you’ll encounter Yetis, giant octopi, sea serpents, Sasquatch (a.k.a. Bigfoot), and even a long stretch of snakeskin that was shed by Wessie, an enormous snake that was spotted in the city of Westbrook in August 2016. You might remember when Wessie Fever gripped the state — there was a Wessie street festival, a folk song, and a local beer named after the reptile. The Westbrook Police Department verified the shed Wessie skin through DNA testing, and then donated it to the museum, Coleman says.

Bigfoot, the Rock Star

Even among cryptids, the boldface names are attention-grabbers, celebrity cryptids such as Bigfoot, Yetis, Nessies, and Sea Serpents, joined in recent years by Mothman, Champ, and Chupacabaras. “Bigfoot is a rock star these days — he’s as big as the Beatles,” says museum volunteer Daniel Knight. Bigfoot has been the subject of movies, including “Harry and the Hendersons” (1987) and 2019′s animated “Missing Link,” along with a series of Sasquatch-themed beef jerky commercials. And isn’t that a Bigfoot (“My name is Darryl”) in an insurance company ad? Clearly, Bigfoot has arrived. Recent publicity aside, Bigfoot is one of the most enduring legends in North American history.

Even if you’re not a Bigfoot fan, you’ll want to view video footage of “Patty,” shot in 1967 by amateur trackers Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin in California’s Bluff Creek area. This footage is a key piece in the Bigfoot puzzle, Knight notes. It reveals a hair-covered creature walking in the woods, and turning to face the camera at one point. Researchers have taken this footage apart frame-by-frame and they can’t figure out how it was done, Knight says. “People have tried to fake footage like this, and they can’t do it.” Even Hollywood special effects people are stymied by the lifelike way Patty looks and moves. Could she have been a human being with a condition such as hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), hiding in the woods away from prying eyes? Or is Patty proof that Bigfoot lives? Either way, she gets into your head. And that’s the point of all this.

“I never use the word ‘believe’ or ‘belief,’ ” Coleman says. “We have a skeptical but open-minded stance. We are not here to convince anyone of the existence of any of these creatures.” The ultimate challenge is to discover biological evidence of new species, he says. Chances are, you’ll connect with something here, whether it’s Patty, an ancient (or furry) fish, or a Yeti, a.k.a. the Abominable Snowman, typically spotted in the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet.

Yetis are adorable, if they look anything like the toy counterparts on display here, but are they real? We don’t know — and that’s the appeal. “People love mysteries and they love animals,” Coleman says. "Cryptozoology is science with a mix of entertainment, education, and fun thrown in.

“The museum is a physical reminder that wonder and passion — and research — still exist in this world. Everyone can enjoy the quest,” he says. Plus, it’s a lot more fun to contemplate Abominable Snowmen than it is to think about invisible germs that are out to get us.

And if all of this creeps you out? Well, there’s a distillery right next door.

Small-town dating is not a Hallmark movie


‘Do I keep casting a 1,000-mile-radius dating-app net and pray that someone out there is in the same boat?’


By Meredith Goldstein Globe Staff,Updated November 16, 2020, 2:00 p.m.



A scene from Hallmark Channel's "Holiday Date."Allister Foster/Crown Media/Hallmark Channel





Q. In the era of Coronapocalypse and feeling isolated, I figured I would shoot you an e-mail and see if I could get your thoughts on my situation.

I live in the middle of nowhere. I quite literally live almost in the dead center of the US. I have lived in larger cities, but now I’ve ended up in my hometown, 41 and divorced.

I am definitely happier being out of my miserable marriage. And I have actually gained a greater appreciation for this small town. But dating in the small town you grew up in when you have three kids in tow is NOT what it looks like on the Hallmark Channel. Which is why I am e-mailing you.



I’ve created accounts on dating apps, but I am limited to about three people in a 100-mile radius that I match with. I met someone online a few weeks back, but he was about five hours from where I live. We really clicked. I genuinely was interested in him. But he had no interest in dating someone long-distance.

So while I love your podcast and hearing the stories and advice you give others, I have NO IDEA how to relate to the people you give advice to in Boston or NYC. It is so easy to meet people in a larger city. I’ve done it. There’s just more fish to shoot at in that barrel. In this town of less than 200,000, I have no idea how to meet anyone. I feel like I likely will be single until I can ship my kids off to college in eight years and finally move. At which point I will be almost 50 and feel like I will be all washed up.

How do I do this? Do I just give up and wait? Do I keep casting a 1,000-mile-radius dating-app net and pray that someone out there is in the same boat?

SMALL-TOWN SINGLE





A. People in cities might tell you that it’s not so easy for them. When you have too many options, it can present another kind of problem. But hopefully this letter will give them some perspective.

My thought is that yes, you should continue with the 100-mile-radius search ... maybe 150. See what you find, and in a world where people are working remotely, maybe it’ll be easier to make a date.

Also, remember that your town is just one small town. The other lead in your own personal Hallmark movie might be six towns over, thinking the same thing. I just feel like ... our current events have inspired many people to return home, seek more space, and visit relatives who can help them with expenses and kids. Who knows how the demographics of your area will continue to change?

I also wonder whether you have to be exactly where you are until you’re 50. It’s not that I think you should move to find love, but the best place for you is wherever you can have your own fun with friends. You should be surrounded by some people you like. Does your hometown offer that kind of community?

That’s a lot of advice you could have come up with yourself. For that, I apologize; there are no magic answers here. I’ll remind you that dating is a slog and takes patience no matter where you are.

I’ll also say that 50 is not washed up unless you want it to be.

READERS RESPOND:

Less than 200,000 isn’t a small town. I live in a town of 95,000 and there’s no way I’ll meet the same people over and over or exhaust any opportunity to make new friends.

FINNOKEY





Don’t worry, one day you are going to have your car break down when you are short on cash. A middle-aged, gruff, but heart of gold mechanic is going to bail you out. He is too shy to ask you out, but when you start dating the town Lothario, he will find the courage to tell you, “You can do better than that...” meaning himself. Love will fill the air, the end.

HEYITHINK





^And it will happen on Christmas Day.

ALLUSERNAMESARETAKEN





I hope 50 isn’t washed up!

JONRUNSGRAFTON





^It wasn’t for me, and that was 23 years ago.

JESNANA





^"Washed up" is a state of mind, not an event on the calendar.
